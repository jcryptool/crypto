    <description>Divider Game is a game for two people invented by Christiane Licht.
    
This is how the game works.
A number is chosen. The playing field is then made up of all of the dividers of that number.

The players take turns in selecting a divider. Selected divisors and their multiples are removed.
The player who selects or has to select the 1 has lost.

Both Human vs. Human [1P / 2P] and Human vs. Computer [1P / Computer] games can be played.

The divider game picks up a question of game theory: Is there always an optimal winning move for the player who starts,
no matter what numbers the other player then choses?
