      <description>Huffman coding is a method for lossless data compression which assigns to each character of the input text a bit sequence of a variable length depending on the frequency of the occurrence of this character. Frequent characters are represented with a short bit sequence; characters occurring rarely have a longer bit sequence. In this way, redundant information is summarized and the required storage space reduced.</description>
