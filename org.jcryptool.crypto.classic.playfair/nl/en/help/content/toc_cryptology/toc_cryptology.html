<h1>Playfair Cipher</h1>
<p>
	The Playfair cipher is a well-known monoalphabetic digraph substitution cipher, which was mainly used by the British military in World War I.

	The Playfair cipher is the most well-known digraph, monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

<h4>Encryption</h4>

<p>A 5x5 matrix (Playfair matrix) has to be filled with the plaintext alphabet (which means that the plaintext alphabet must contain 25 characters), e.g. by a key word, which is first put into the matrix, and then the other plaintext-alphabet characters are filled in. Then, the plaintext will be split up in pairs, which are substituted with other pairs, following these rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>If both characters of the pair are in the same column of the Playfair matrix, replace each with the character below it in the matrix.</li>

<li>If both characters of the pair are in the same row of the Playfair matrix, replace each with the character right next to it it in the matrix.</li>

<li>If both pair characters stand in different columns and rows in the matrix, replace each of it with the character that stands in the same row, but in the column of the other pair character. </li>

<li>If a pair consists of similar characters, separate them with a filling character (“X”)</li>
</ul>

<p>The text „SIMONIEX“ („X“ as filler to make the text length even) will be encrypted with the key word „ZOELIBAT“. The Playfair matrix is then:</p>

<p>First: splitting the plaintext into pairs: “SI  MO  NI  EX“. Then, substitute, following the rules (see above). For example, „SI“ is substituted with „YD“, following the first rule. The complete ciphertext is „YD GI  SZ  LW“.</p>


<h4>Decryption</h4>

<p>At the decryption, the same Playfair-matrix is used, but the substitution rules have to be reverted (which is trivial). Then the ciphertext has to be split up in pars, and substituted with the inverse rules.</p>
