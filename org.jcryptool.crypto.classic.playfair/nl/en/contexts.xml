    <description>The Playfair cipher is a digraph substitution technique, where every pair of letters gets replaced by another pair of letters. The pairs are generated by a 5x5 square, in which the Latin alphabet, modified in order by the keyword, is inscribed.
&lt;br&gt;The Playfair cipher was mainly used in World War I by the British forces.
