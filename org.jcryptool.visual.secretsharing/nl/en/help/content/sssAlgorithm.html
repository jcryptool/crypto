   <h1>Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm</h1>
   
  <p>
    Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm was developed in 1979 by Adi Shamir as a secret sharing method which
    allows to distribute shares of a secret among several people, and only a subset of them is needed to
    reconstruct the secret.You can compare this with a safe where 3 of 5 different keys are sufficient to open
    it.
  </p>

  <p>Let \(n\) and \(t\) be natural numbers with \(t \leq n\). In a \((n,t)\)-Secret-Sharing-Protocol is
    shared the secret to n people. Every person has a share of the secret. If \(t\) of these people get
    together they can reconstruct the secret. If less than \(t\) together this part secret information they
    can not obtain relevant information about the secret. This principle is much better than cutting a
    treasure map into pieces and distribute the pieces to several people.</p>
    
  <p>Shamir's algorithm uses the Lagrange interpolation in order to reconstruct the polynomial. All
    calculations are carried out in \(\mathbb {Z} /p\mathbb {Z}\).</p>
  
  <p>
  Given, the dealer is the one who wants to distribute a secret \(s \in \mathbb {Z} /p\mathbb {Z}\). 
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>He chooses secret elements \(a_j \in \mathbb {Z} /p\mathbb {Z}\), for every \(j\), \(1 \leq j
      \leq (t - 1)\) and generates the polynomial <br>
      <p style="margin-left: 20pt"> \( \style{} { \begin{align} P(x) = s + \sum{a_jx^j} \end{align} } \)<p>
      The polynomial is of degree \(\leq t - 1\).</li>
    <li>The dealer calculates the shares \(y_i = P(x_i)\) for every \(i\), \(1 \leq i \leq n\)</li>
    <li>The dealer gives every \(i\)-th shareholder its share \(y_i,1 \leq i \leq n\). The secret is
    the constant term \(a_0\) of the polynomial \(P(x)\).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To reconstruct the secret, we assume that t shareholders work together. Their shares were
  \(y_i = P(x_i)\) for every \(i\), \(1 \leq i \leq t\). Here, P(x) is the polynomial from step 1.
  It is</p>
  
  <p style="margin-left: 20pt"> \( \begin{align}
    w_i = y_i \cdot \prod \frac{x_j - x}{x_j - x_i} \mod p \; \text{for every} \; j \; \text{and} \; i, \; 1 \leq j \leq t,\; j \neq i
  \end{align} \)</p>
  
  <p>and</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 20pt"> \( \begin{align}
    P(x) = \sum{w_i} \mod p \; \text{for every} \; i, 1 \leq i \leq t
  \end{align} \)
  </p>
  
  <p>Combined in one formula</p>
  
   <p style="margin-left: 20pt"> \(  \begin{align}
    P(x) = \sum y_i \prod \frac{x_j - x}{x_j - x_i} \mod p \; \text{for every} \; j \; \text{and} \; i, \;
      1 \leq i,t \leq t,\; j \neq i
  \end{align} \) </p>
  
  <p>Since the coefficient \(a_0\) is the secret, we calculate</p>
  
  <p style="margin-left: 20pt"> \( \begin{align}
   s = a_0 = \sum y_i \prod \frac{x_j}{x_j - x_i}  \; \text{for every} \; j \; \text{and} \; i, \;
      1 \leq i,t \leq t,\; j \neq i
  \end{align} \)</p>


  <p>This formula is used by the shareholders in order to reconstruct the secret. We want to show this
    with an example.</p>
    
<h2>Example</h2>

  <p>
    Let \(n = 5\), \(t = 3\). The dealer chooses \(p = 17\), \(x_i = i\) for each \(i\),
    \(1 \leq i \leq 5\). The secret is \(s = 5\). The dealer chooses the secret coefficients
    \(a_1 = 7\) und \(a_2 = 11\). Thus we obtain the polynomial.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 20pt"> \(  \begin{align}
    P(x) = 5 + 7x + 11x^2 \mod 17
  \end{align} \)</p>

  <p>Using \(5\) random values for \(x\), the shares are \(y_1 = P(1) = 6\), \(y_2 = P(2) = 12\), \(y_3 =
    P(3) = 6\), \(y_4 = P(4) = 5\), \(y_5 = P(5) = 9\). These are being distributed to the shareholders. The
    shareholders 1, 2, and 3 now come together to reconstruct the secret. The Lagrange polynomial is
    calculated, and the shares are multiplied with \(y_i\):</p>
    
  <p style="margin-left: 20pt"> \(  \begin{align}
    w_i = y_i \prod \frac{x_j}{x_j - x_i} \quad \text{for every} \;
 i, j , \; 1 \leq i,j \leq 3, j \neq i
  \end{align} \)</p>

<p>This results in the following weights for the shareholders:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20pt"> \( 
  \begin{alignat}{4}
    w_1 &&= 4 +&& 9x +&& 6x^2 &&= 3\\
    w_2 &&= 3 +&& 2x +&& 11x^2 &&= 7\\
    w_3 &&= 15 +&& 13x +&& 11x^2 &&= 13\\
  \end{alignat}\)</p>

<p>Now we compute the sum of the weights \(w_i\) and get the original polynomial this way: </p>

<p style="margin-left: 20pt"> \( \begin{align}
     \sum w_i = 5 + 7x + 11x^2, 1 \leq i \leq 3
  \end{align}\)</p>
