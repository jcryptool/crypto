<h1>Vigenère Cipher</h1>
<p>
	The Vigenère cipher is one of the most widely known substitution techniques. It is a polyalphabetic substitution, and shifts letters of the plaintext down the alphabet, according to the Caesar cipher. The difference is that the key can contain multiple letters, and so the letters are shifted not only by one offset. The Vigenère chiffre was considered unbreakable a long time, until Charles Babbage succeeded in deciphering it first in 1854.

<p>
	The Vigenère cipher belongs to the polyalphabetic substitution ciphers and is their most prominent representative.

<h3 id="algorithm">The en- and decryption algorithm</h3>

<p>The Vigenère-Encryption is a polyalphabetic
substitution, where the single alphabets are Caesar substitution alphabets.
Thus, encrypting a text with the Vigenère algorithm is just Caesar-encrypting
every n-th character with the first character of the key, the next n-th
characters with the second character of the key, and so on.</p>


<h4>Encryption</h4>

<p>An encryption is best prepared by writing
the key which encrypts a character below it. In the following example, the text
“ATTACKATMIDNIGHT” is encrypted with the keyword “KEY”. So, every third
character is Caesar-encrypted with “K”, the next set of n-th-characters is
encrypted with “E”, and the rest with “Y”:</p>

<h4>Decryption</h4>

<p>To decrypt a Vigenère-encrypted text, the
shift of characters from the encryption has to be reverted, like decrypting a
Caesar-ciphertext – with the difference that different shifts have to be
reverted. It’s also possible to inverse-encrypt it, by generating the inverse
key to the encryption key, and “encrypting” the ciphertext with it. This
inverse key is generated by taking each character (“each Caesar key”) and
reverting it separately – the inversion rule is (Caesar-key: k, inverse Caesar-key:
i): i = length(plain text alphabet) – k.</p>
