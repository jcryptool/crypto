	 * There is a good reason why the block size for the message and the cipher
	 * are not the same. It all has to do with bitCounts not evenly divisible by 8.
	 * Since all encryption and decryption work is done via bytes (8 bits), other bitCounts
	 * cannot be done in a straightforward style where message.length == ciphertext.length.
	 * If we do nothing, and let the blockSize be universal and rounded down, then many
	 * values will encrypt into values that require an extra byte (since N itself requires
	 * that extra byte, were it to be stored as a byte array), and this messes up the plan.
	 * If we keep the blockSize shared but round it up, then sometimes we will take a set
	 * of bytes that turn out to be greater than N - which means that in decryption, we
	 * will get the wrong value back. By rounding the message blockSize down but the ciphertext's
	 * up, we keep a constant and controllable message size and if the ciphertext requires
	 * an extra byte, we can handle it. This is not perfect, but it is functional.
	 * Downsides are that all bitCounts not divisble by 8 create ciphertexts that are
	 * longer than their messages, and bitCounts less than 8 should not be allowed,
	 * since the only possible prime pair is (5,7) and thus N = 35, so only characters less
	 * with ASCII values less than 35 can be encoded. Even with bitCount = 8, the only prime
	 * pair is (11,13) and N = 143, which will still cause problems for non ASCII-7 characters.
	 * To be able to encrypt all UTF-16 characters, the minimum bit length is 18.
