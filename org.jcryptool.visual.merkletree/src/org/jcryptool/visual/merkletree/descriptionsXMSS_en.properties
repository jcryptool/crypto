Tab0_Head0=eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme	

Tab0_Txt0=The eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS) is a Scheme, that extends the Merkle Signature Scheme. One Advantage of the XMSS is, that the generated Signatures are smaller as in the MSS. An other Difference to the MSS is the Usage of the Bitmask Q and the L-Tree. With this two Extensions, the used collision resistant hash function can be replaced by a second preimage resistant hash function.
Tab0_Txt2=The XMSS uses the Winternitz One Time Signature (WOTS) Scheme in the Seedmode, which generates the Keys with the help of a Seed. One must use 2^n keys because else there are problems with the verification of XMSS. For more information please consult the help menu.

#christoph -> not finished yet, text missing!!
Tab1_Txt0=The MerkleTree shown here is created with the hashes of the public Keys. Those are combined, than there is an XOR Operation with the Bitmask and after this Operation, the Value gets hashed again, till only the root remains. \r\n\r\nTo sign a message, first the message will be signed with a pseudorand WOTS Keypair. The XMSS signature contains the the index of the Keypair, the WOTS signature and the content of the Nodes which are colored red after clicking a leaf.\r\n\r\nVerification:\r\nFor a successful Verification of a Message the following informations are needed: \r\n\u2022 The Message \r\n\u2022 The Signature of the Message \r\n\u2022 The XMSS Public-Key \r\n\r\nFirst the One-time-signature is beeing checked, if this check fails, the following steps can be skipped. 
Tab1_Txt1=Choose a Node to see the Hashvalue of it.

Tab2_Txt0=The Signature of the Message has the following content: Index of the Keypair | OTS-Signature | Authentication Path
