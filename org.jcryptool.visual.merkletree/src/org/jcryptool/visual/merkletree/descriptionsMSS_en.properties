Tab0_Head0=Merkle Signature Scheme

Tab0_Txt0=Merkle Signature Scheme is a  way to sign messages and prove both the integrity and the authorship of a message. The Scheme combines One Time Signatures and a MerkleTree. The OTS signs the message itself, while the MerkleTree reduces the ammount of data that must be transfered for multiple Signatures. Only the tree root, the Merkle public key must be transfered over a secure communications path.
Tab0_Txt2=Merkle Signature Scheme uses the Winternitz One Time Signature (WOTS) Scheme in the Seedmode, which generates the Keys with the help of a Seed. One must use 2^n keys because else there are problems with the verification of Merkle signatures. For more information please consult the help menu.

Tab1_Head0=Merkle Signature Scheme
Tab1_Txt0=The MerkleTree shown here is created with the hashes of the public Keys. Those are combined and hashed again h(m1|m2), \r\ntill only the root remains. \r\n\r\n To sign a message, first the message will be signed with the One Time Singature (OTS). The Merkle Signature contains the OTS Signature, the index of the key in relation to the MerkleTree and the content of the Nodes which are colored red after clicking a leaf.
Tab1_Txt1=Choose a Node to see the Hashvalue of it.

Tab2_Txt0=The Signature of the Message has the following content: Index of the Keypair | OTS-Signature | OTS-Public Key | Authentication Path
