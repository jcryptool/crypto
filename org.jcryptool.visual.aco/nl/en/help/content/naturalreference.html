<h1>The native model</h1>
<p>
The first Ant Colony Optimization algorithm was presented in 1992 by Marco Dorigo and was able to
solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. But further more the algorithm is a meta heuristic which can be 
applied on many different kinds of combinatorial optimization problems.
So nowadays there exists various variants of the algorithm. The basic concepts of the algorithm is copied
from the method of ants finding  efficiently their way to their food in nature.
As one ant alone is not capable of finding the way but in the collective they are, this 
kind of intelligence is called swarm intelligence.
</p><p>
Research on ants have shown, that ants are capable of building trails from their nest to 
the appropriate food reservoir on the shortest trail possible. As insects are known to be
creatures with limited cognitive abilities, each of the ant is not able to find the way on its own.
But considered as a collective, whole ant colonies have kind of a "collective brain". Important is 
to note that each ant is self-organised and they are not controlled centralized. Each ant decides on its own.
<br><br>
So how do they do they find the shortest possible path?<br>
The answer lies in the pheromones of the ants. Pheromones are scents which help ants to orient oneself. First, ants
will randomly explore the surrounding of their nest. Once an ant found an amount of food, 
she will carry it back to the nest and emit the pheromon, the amount of pheromon depends on the
quality and quantity of food it just has found. Some kinds of ants as well constantly emit
the pheromones, even before they have found some food.<br>
Now, following ant will tend to choose a way which is marked more intensively with the pheromone. 
As more ants will choose the way, the amount of pheromone will increase potentially, and the way will
be much more attractive for following ants.

In case that different ants found different ways to the same source of food, after a while the shorter path will be
automatically marked with more pheromone, as the time for the longer path is higher. So more 
ants will way more frequently pass the shorter path, such that the shorter path will be marked more.<br>
<br><img src="image2.png" style="width: 85%; max-width:450px"/><br><br>
For example let two ways exist and let one be of length half the other. Consider two ants starting
at the same time on those two not yet marked ways (\(P_A = 0\) and \(P_B = 0\) ).
The ant on the shorter path will already have reached
the source, when the other is just on the half of its way. When the first ant will already be back at the nest,
the second ant will just be at the source. So now when other ants will leave the nest, they will find those
two possible ways, but the shorter one will already be marked twice, as the previous ant has already
passed it twice (\(P_A = 2\)). The longer path will only be marked once. So the following ants
will more likely choose the shorter path.
<br><img src="image3.png" style="width: 85%; max-width:450px"/><br><br>
When finally the ant on the long trail will reach the nest, multiple ants will have chosen the
short path so the shorter path will be marked more quickly.<br>
<br><img src="image4.png" style="width: 85%; max-width:450px"/><br><br>
As each ants continues on emitting the pheromone, the scents will be concentrated on the 
better and shorter paths.
Important as well is the phenomen of evaporation, the scent will not mark a path for ever. After 
a while the pheromone will be evaporated. So the long way an ant once has chosen will not be considered by
following ants at some point of time. Even more, once a even shorter path is found, the short path
before will eventually disappear.<br>
So a suboptimal trail can be even optimized by this behaviour. This happens as every ant still decides
on its own which way to choose and some ants will try other trails. And the phenomen repeats.
Finally, they will find the shortest possible path.<br>
Researches have shown that if the ants found two trails of the same length, the ants
will prefer one of them, but the preference does not depend on the trail which was found
first. Up to a certain amount of pheromone on the trail a change of the preference of the
trail seems still to be possible.
<br>
This kind of swarm intelligence has not only been observed for ants, as well some kinds of fish and
birds and other insects are capable of such a kind of intelligence. Important is that there
is no centralized system to organise them in swarms. The swarm intelligence is as well quite interesting
for the adaption to artificial intelligence.
