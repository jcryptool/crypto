ECView_Title=Elliptic Curve Calculations
ECView_Description=Select the type of curve and fill in the curve attributes.\nIt's then possible to perform calculations on the curve (addition of two points and scalar multiplication of a point).
ECView_LargeDescription=Select the type of curve and fill in the curve attributes.\nLarge elliptic curves are used in professional cryptography. Because of the size of the curves, it's not possible to display a grid or the points of the curve.
