	<h2 id="func">Description of the algorithm</h2>

	<p>
	RC4 and ARC4 respectively are cryptographic stream ciphers. RC4 became well known and widespread mainly because of its usage in standards
	like HTTPS, SSH1 or WEP/WPA. RC4 has been developed by Ronald L. Rivest in the year 1987 as a trademark of RSA Security Inc., today a
 	subsidiary of EMC Corporation. Therefore, RC4 is not a freely accessible crypto algorithm. Alleged RC4 (ARC4) is based on an anonymous
	publication of source code (1994). Now it is open-source and freely usable.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Like any stream cipher RC4 generates a (pseudo-)random bitstream which is then used as keystream to encrypt the plaintext through an exclusive disjunction
 	(XOR). The result of this operation is the ciphertext. The basis of this generation in RC4 is a so called s-box. This s-box is a byte-vector with 
 	256 elements initially assigned with the consecutive values from 0 to 255. Afterwards these values will be permutated using the key.
	After this initialization the algorithm generates the random bitstream using well-defined calculation rules. Every single step of the
	generation concludes with the swapping of two values inside the s-box. The calculations of the RC4 algorithm uses very simple operations,
	therefore it is easy to implement the algorithm in hardware and software. The execution of the algorithm itself is pretty fast in comparison
 	to other stream ciphers.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The algorithm looks like the following. First of all the byte-vector (called s-box) will be filled with initial values:
	</p>

	<pre>
		k[] := key (length between 5 and 256 bytes)
		L   := length of the key (in bytes)
		s[] := byte-vector with 256 bytes

		For i = 0 to 255
			s[i] = i
		j = 0
		For i = 0 to 255
			j = (j + s[i] + k[i mod L]) mod 256
			swap s[i] and s[j]
	</pre>

	<p>
	The generation of the pseudo-random bitstream and the encryption look like this:
	</p>

	<pre>
		plain[]  := plaintext of length X
		cipher[] := storage for the ciphertext
		i = 0
		j = 0

		For n = 0 to X-1
			i = (i + 1) mod 256
			j = (j + s[i]) mod 256
			swap s[i] and s[j]
			rand = s[ (s[i] + s[j]) mod 256 ]
			cipher[n] = rand XOR plain[n]
	</pre>

	<p>
	On October 27th, 2014, Ronald Rivest and Jacob Schuldt released an improved version of RC4 under the name "Spritz". Both, RC4
	and Spritz, are using a very similar algorithm, but in Spritz a few calculations and rules have been changed a bit.
	Additionally a new parameter <i>w</i> has been added, which can have any odd value between 1 and 255.
	More detailed information on Spritz can be
	found in the references listed below (especially in the article written by Bruce Schneier).
	</p>

	<h2 id="sec">Security of (A)RC4</h2>

	<p>
	Stream ciphers can only be secure if the random bitstream generated by the algorithm is never the same, and if there is no way to predict 
	the output of the generator with a better success chance than 1/2 (the
	chance of success when just guessing). To achieve this, it is necessary to keep the key for the algorithm secret and to use the key only
	once. Like all other stream ciphers it doesn't ensure integrity.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A few weaknesses of the RC4 algorithm (some of them being really serious) where shown in <i>Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of
	RC4</i> by Scott Fluhrer, Itsik Mantin, and Adi Shamir in 2002. The weaknesses shown in this paper are mainly based on the derivation of the
	initial state of RC4 using the key, but they also have consequences for the generation of the bitstream. In the mentioned
	paper, which is verbalized in a very mathematical way, the authors create an algorithm derived from RC4. Based on this altered RC4 they
	show that certain patterns in the key are correlating with certain patterns in the internal state of RC4 and as a result the key or parts
	of it may be calculated with the initial state, where the effort to this is based on the length of the key. Afterwards the authors
	prove that this weakness is present in the standard RC4 algorithm, too. On top of this, there is a strong correlation of the input key
	and the output of the random generator, when a key out of a relatively large class of weak keys is used. Because of this it is possible
	to develop efficient algorithms capable of breaking RC4's security. Such an algorithm created by Shamir and Mantin is able to detect the
	difference between the generator's output and real random numbers only with the second word of the output. As a result they recommend to
	ignore the first and the second word and not to use them for encryption. Later they realized that one can calculate parts of the key
	out of the output although dumping the first 2 words with an effort of 2<sup>21</sup> (an effort of 2<sup>80</sup> or more is
	required today for secure techniques in cryptography).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Another severe weakness works like this: The key <i>K</i> for the algorithm consists of a secret part <i>sec</i> and a so-called initialization vector <i>IV</i> which is known to the public (and so it is to the attacker), and therefore <i>K = sec + IV</i>.
	Under the precondition that the user uses the secret part of the key not only once, an attacker may be capable to calculate the secret
	key with the help of the output and the (known) <i>IV</i> with relatively low effort (the effort depends on the length of the key and the
	<i>IV</i>, of course). In reality it is often possible to guess the first words of the plaintext (for example if the first words are
	timestamps or the identity of a client in some protocols), which makes a ciphertext-only attack possible. In such an attack the attacker
	can break the encryption using only the ciphertext. Additionally, Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir show the possibility of
	practically using these weaknesses to attack certain crypto systems and techniques like the old, but wide-spread wireless security
	standard WEP.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In his paper <i>Attacks on the RC4 stream cipher</i>, published in 2006, Andreas Klein described another attack, which is mainly based on the attack already
	shown by Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir (which is also called <i>FMS attack</i>). In this method Klein observed the operations and states of
	the algorithm in the stage of generating the key and the output of the algorithm. With this procedure Klein was able to calculate a
	previous state of the algorithm with high efficiency. To make things worse he also exposed the fact that his new attack works with
	the first 256 bytes discarded, too. This is why he recommends users to dump the outputs of at least the first 12 rounds of the algorithm
	in order to make an attack impossible or at least very hard (where one round equals 256 bytes of output). 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In March 2013, AlFardan, Bernstein, Paterson, Poettering, and Schuldt
	described one of the latest attack scenarios on RC4. In this scenario an attacker can read a few messages encrypted with RC4 and then
	sent over TLS connections. Here it is necessary that the same plaintext is encrypted and sent over more than just one connection. The
	authors use statistical biases in the key generation of RC4 which allows differentiating between the created output and really
	random bits. These results enable an attacker to break the security of RC4. They recommend not to use RC4 anymore
	and to use secure cipher suites instead (like the fast and secure AES in GCM mode).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The German website <i>golem.de</i> (which is a webpage for news in the field of information technology) published an article on
	January 20th, 2015. According to this article two groups of scientists announced the publication of some new attacks on ARC4 in the
	near future. The whole article can be read
	<a href="http://www.golem.de/news/verschluesselung-neue-angriffe-auf-rc4-1501-111805.html">here</a> (in German).
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Reports about these new attacks can be found in <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Verschluesselung-Deutlich-verbesserte-Angriffe-auf-RC4-2586774.html">heise</a>
	from March 27th, 2015, and in <a href="http://www.golem.de/news/verschluesselung-rc4-erneut-unter-beschuss-1503-113189.html">Golem</a> from March 26th, 2015.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	To sum things up, all relevant organizations and authorities like the <i>European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)</i> or the German
	<i>Federal Office for Information Security</i> (in German: <i>Bundesamt f&uuml;r Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)</i>) recommend
	not to use RC4 any longer. Instead, one should use secure standards like the stream ciphers <i>Rabbit</i> or <i>Snow 3G</i>, or the
	block cipher <i>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</i>, which is probably the most popular encryption standard today.
	The IETF decided with its publication of RFC 7465 in February 2015 that using RC4 in TLS is prohibited.

	<h2 id="user_instruct">User instructions for this plugin</h2>

	<p>
	Start the visualization by clicking on <i>ARC4 / Spritz</i> in the submenu <i>Visuals</i>. As a result a new window opens up.
	At the top you can see a descriptive text about the visualization and instructions for its usage. Similar instructions are shown in
	tooltips when hovering over an element (for example a button) with your cursor.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Below this text there is a matrix with 2 dimensions named byte vector. This is the representation of the s-box with all the 
	values stored in it. The vector is filled with numbers from 0 to 255 in hexadecimal notation directly after opening up the window.
	</p>
	<img src="screenshot_vector.png" width="80%" height="80%" alt="s-box">

	<p>On the right hand side you can see a group box with a headline reading <i>Variables</i>. The values of the internal variables
	<i>i</i> and <i>j</i> are displayed, as well as a counter for already finished steps. At the beginning all of these values will be 0. All values
	are displayed in decimal and hexadecimal notation.
	</p>
	<img src="screenshot_variables.png" alt="variables">

	<p>
	Under the variables there is another group box called <i>Control of the algorithm</i>. With the elements here you can control the procedure of the algorithm.
	In the text field <i>Number of steps</i> you can write a positive value which represents the number of steps you want the algorithm to process at once.
	When clicking on <i>Execute</i> the algorithm will execute the entered number of steps. When clicking on <i>Encrypt all</i> the algorithm will
	finish the encryption completely. Please note that the algorithm in this visualization has exactly 272 steps. 256 of them are
	required for the initial permutation of the s-box with the key. The rest (16 steps) are required for generating 16 random bytes and
	to exclusively XORing them with the 16 plaintext bytes.</p>
	<img src="screenshot_control.png" alt="controls">

	<p>In the next group box (<i>Selection of algorithm</i>) you can choose the algorithm you want to see. ARC4 (as default) and the modern version Spritz are
	available. If choosing Spritz an additional parameter is required (called <i>w</i>). You can set this parameter with the dropdown-box
	(this box will become active when choosing Spritz). Valid values for <i>w</i> are all odd numbers between 1 and 255 (numbers 1 and 255
	inclusive). The selection of the algorithm can only be changed before starting the visualization.</p>
	<img src="screenshot_choose.png" alt="choose">

	<p>
	Below this group box there is another one called <i>Misc settings</i>. Here you can make the plug-in to highlight the last changes in the s-box by clicking
	<i>Highlight changes</i>. By choosing <i>Do not highlight changes</i> you can disable this feature. With a click on <i>Reset count</i>
	the step counter will be set to 0 again, which means all changes will be undone (plaintext and key will remain the same). With the button
	<i>Randomize</i> the key and the plaintext will be randomly generated. This function is available only before starting the algorithm, of
	course.
	</p>
	<img src="screenshot_misc.png" alt="misc">

	<p>
	Under the s-box at the bottom of the window there are 4 vectors representing the plaintext, the key, the randomly generated bytes, and
	the ciphertext. In this visualization all of them are exactly 16 bytes long. For all four vectors there is a button <i>Copy to clipboard</i> 
	to copy the
	value of the corresponding vector to the clipboard of your system in order to reuse the values in another application.
	The key and the plaintext are prefilled with randomly
	chosen values at the beginning. Of course, you can change these values for these two vectors by clicking the <i>Choose</i> button next 
	to the corresponding vector.
	</p>
	<img src="screenshot_button_choose_key.png" alt="choose key">
	<img src="screenshot_button_clipboard.png" alt="copy to clipboard">

	<p>
	In both cases a wizard will open up. In this wizard you can enter the key (or the plaintext) in hexadecimal notation. There are 16 bytes
	available for your input (which means you can enter 32 hex symbols). Wrong inputs, like symbols that are no hexadecimal numbers, will be
	ignored and an according message will be displayed directly beneath the input field. You can close the wizard at any time by simply
	clicking on <i>Cancel</i>. In this case your input will be dumped and the old value of the key or plaintext will not be changed. After
	entering 16 bytes you can click on the button <i>Finish</i> to accept the input and the plaintext/key will be changed accordingly.
	Please note that the key and the plaintext can only be changed if you did not already start the algorithm with a 
	click on <i>Execute</i> (so the value of <i>Step</i> is still 0).
	</p>
	<img src="screenshot_wizard_key.png" alt="wizard">
	
	<p>
	Remark: In the ARC4 visualization plug-in the key has to have a length of exactly 16 bytes. In the ARC4 crypto plug-in the keylength 
	can vary between 5 and 256 bytes (according to the spec of the algorithm).
	</p>

	<p>When <i>Step</i> in the group box <i>variables</i> shows the value 272, the algorithm has finished and the complete ciphertext can be seen at the
	bottom of the window. When clicking then on either <i>Execute</i> or <i>Encrypt all</i> again, a message will appear informing you about this fact.
	If you want to start the visualization once again, you can click on the small button at the top left of the window (the tooltip reads <i>Restart</i>
	when hovering over the button with the cursor of your mouse). It is located at the top if the window, left of the buttons <i>Minimize</i>
	and <i>Restore</i>.</p>
	<img src="screenshot_button_restart.png" alt="RestartButton">

	<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

	<p>
	As a last point of this help text we show a little example of how to encrypt a text with 
	both ARC plug-ins within JCT, the <b>visualization plug-in</b> and the 
	<b><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.crypto.modern.stream.arc4/nl/en/help/content/UI/tutorialUI.html">crypto plug-in</a></b>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Remark: Within the ARC4 crypto plug-in you can encrypt plaintexts or decrypt ciphertexts of arbitrary length 
	(stored in a file or in the JCT editor). In contrast, the ARC4 visualization plug-in has an input length of exactly 
	16 bytes (as its purpose is the visualization not the encryption of mass data).
	</p>

	<p>
	First, an example plaintext has to be chosen. The visualization limits the length of the plaintext to exactly 16 bytes, therefore we
	only use 16 bytes for our plaintext:
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>AA BB CC DD EE FF 00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99</b>
	</p>

	<p>
	In the <b>visualization</b> this can be achieved by simply opening the plug-in and then clicking the <i>Choose</i> button for plaintext. 
	In the wizard simply enter the text above. Afterwards simply click on <i>Finish</i>.<br>
	In the <b>crypto plug-in</b> you have to open up an empty file first. To do this, simply click on <i>File->New->Empty File in Hexeditor</i>.
	In the empty file click with the right button of your mouse and then choose <i>Append</i> in the context menu. For the value
	<i>Amount of data to append</i> you may enter a value of 16. The unit is <i>B</i> (for Byte). Afterwards click on <i>OK</i>. A new
	line should appear inside the file. Now you can enter the plaintext by clicking on each cell of the line and then entering two hex values
	with the keyboard.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In addition to the plaintext a key is needed for encryption. In this example we will use:
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 AA BB CC DD EE FF</b>
	</p>

	<p>In the <b>visualization</b> you can enter this key by clicking on the appropriate <i>Choose</i> button next to the key 
	vector and then typing the key in the wizard.<br>
	In the <b>crypto plug-in</b> just enter the key into the text field of the entry dialog or copy it from the clipboard via the context menu.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	To encrypt the text you may click on <i>Encrypt all</i> in the <b>visualization</b> (or you may watch the process step by step). In the
	<b>crypto plug-in</b> make sure you chose the options <i>Encrypt</i> and <i>ARC4</i> and then click <i>Finish</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
	In the <b>visualization</b> the result is displayed at the bottom in the vector for the ciphertext. When using the
	<b>crypto plug-in</b> a new hex editor window will be opened with the ciphertext.
	The resulting text in both cases should look like this:
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>2F E0 60 8A 7C D8 61 94 DA 6A FD 6E F3 32 F5 0D</b>
	</p>
	<img src="screenshot_complete.png" alt="example picture complete">
	
	<p>
	Remark: The screenshots for the crypto plug-in are at the end of the online help for the
	<b><a href=<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.crypto.modern.stream.arc4/nl/en/help/content/UI/tutorialUI.html">crypto plug-in</a></b>.
