  <h1>Homomorphic Encryption</h1>

  <p>This help file consists of three parts, namely a <a href="#term">term clarification</a>, an <a href="#schemes">explanation of the three schemes</a> and <a href="#plugin">plug-in handling instructions</a>. </p>

  <h2 id="term">1) Term Clarification</h2>

  <p>A homomorphic encryption scheme is an encryption scheme which allows homomorphic operations to be performed on the ciphertext, without needing or being able to decrypt. These homomorphic operations are addition and multiplication, and performing these operations implies the same algebraic operations on the plaintext.<br/>
  There are three types of homomorphic encryption schemes, <a href="#partial">partially</a>, <a href="#somewhat">somewhat</a>, and <a href="#fully">fully</a> homomorphic encryption schemes. The differences between these schemes are explained below. <br/>
  This visualization in JCT incorporates three different schemes, namely a fully homomorphic encryption scheme by <a href="#gh">Gentry and Halevi</a>, and two partially homomorphic encryption schemes &ndash; <a href="#rsa">RSA</a> and <a href="#paillier">Paillier</a>. </p>

  <h3 id="partial">a) Partially Homomorphic Encryption</h3>

  <p>When a scheme is partially homomorphic, either multiplication or addition can be performed on the ciphertext. In general, these schemes allow an indefinite amount of operations to be performed. </p>

  <h3 id="somewhat">b) Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption</h3>

  <p>A somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme allows both homomorphic operations to be performed on the ciphertext, but the amount of consecutive operations is limited. One may interpret this as an error being introduced with every operation that is performed. When this error is small, the scheme can still correctly decrypt the ciphertext. But if many operations are performed, this error grows beyond the error-correcting ability of the scheme, which leads to incorrect decryption. </p>

  <h3 id="fully">c) Fully Homomorphic Encryption</h3>

  <p>Fully homomorphic encryption schemes allow an indefinite amount of both homomorphic operations to be performed. This is closely related to the somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes. In addition to the normal operations, a fully homomorphic scheme allows the ciphertext to be "refreshed" without decrypting, i.e. the error in the ciphertext is reduced thus allowing additional operations whilst remaining within the error-correcting ability. </p>

  <h2 id="schemes">2) Scheme Explanation</h2>

  <h3 id="rsa">a) RSA - Partially Homomorphic Encryption Scheme</h3>

  <p>RSA is a widely used public-key cryptography system, which allows <b>multiplication</b> on the
  ciphertexts. It roughly works as follows (for more information see <a target="_blank"
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)</a>): Two large distinct primes, \(p\) and \(q\),
  are selected. The larger these primes, the higher the security. Then, one computes the product
  \(N\) of these primes. Next, one chooses a public exponent \(e\) coprime to \((p-1)(q-1)\).
  The coprimality is to ensure that the multiplicative inverse of \(e\) modulo \((p-1)(q-1)\)
  exists. This inverse is computed using the euclidean algorithm and is called \(d\), which is the
  private exponent. With this done the scheme is ready to be used, the public key consists of \(N\)
  and \(e\), and the private key consists of \(d\). <br/>
  Encryption and decryption of numbers in RSA is very straightforward. To encrypt a number \(m\),
  one simply computes \(c = m^e \mod N\). To decrypt a ciphertext \(c\), one only needs to compute
  \(m' = c^d \mod N = m^{e \cdot d} \mod N = m\).
  </p>
  <p>
  Now to see that RSA is partially homomorphic, consider two numbers \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) and their
  respective ciphertexts \(c_1\) and \(c_2\). To compute the product \(m_1 \cdot m_2\)
  homomorphically, one simply computes the product of the ciphertexts, \(c_1 \cdot c_2\).
  This then decrypts to \(m_1 \cdot m_2\):
  </p>

  \( \style{text-align:right;} {
    \begin{align*}
    (c_1 \cdot c_2)^d \mod N = (c_1^d)\cdot(c_2^d) \mod N = (m_1^{e \cdot d}) \cdot
    (m_2^{e \cdot d}) \mod N = m_1 \cdot m_2
    \end{align*}
  } \)

  <p>
  It is also clear that this can be repeated indefinitely. The only constraint on the
  multiplications is that the operands are \(\leq N\). But because of the size of \(N\) for secure
  encryption, this is no practical boundary. This scheme is only partially homomorphic because one
  is only able to perform multiplications.
  </p>

  <h3 id="paillier">b) Paillier - Partially Homomorphic Encryption Scheme</h3>

  <p>Paillier is an encryption scheme which allows <b>addition</b> on the ciphertexts. The scheme
  works as follows (for more details see <a target="_blank"
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem">
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem</a>: One selects two large primes \(p\) and
  \(q\) with the additional property that \(\gcd(p \cdot q,(p-1)(q-1)) = 1\). This property always
  holds when \(p\) and \(q\) are of the same bit size. Now, one computes \(N = p \cdot q\) and
  \(l = \text{lcm}(p-1,q-1)\). Next, one selects a random integer \(g\) between 1 and \(N^2\), \(N\)
  should divide the order of \(g\). Then one computes
  \(\mu = ( \, L \, (g^{\,l} \; \text{mod} \; N^2))^{-1} \; \text{mod} \; N\), where \(L(u) = \frac{u-1}{N}\). Now the public
  key contains \(N\) and \(g\), and the private key contains \(l\) and \(\mu\).
  <br>
  To encrypt with Paillier, one selects an integer \(m\) between 1 and \(N\). Then one randomly
  selects an invertible integer \(r\) between 1 and \(N\), and computes
  \(c = (g^m) \cdot(r^N) \; \text{mod} \; N^2\). To decrypt a ciphertext \(c\), one simply computes
  \(m = L(c^{\,l} \; \text{mod} \; N^2) \cdot \mu \; \text{mod} \; N\).
  <br>
  To see that Paillier is partially homomorphic, consider having two numbers \(m_1\) and \(m_2\)
  together with their respective ciphertexts \(c_1\) and \(c_2\). To compute the sum \(m_1+m_2\)
  homomorphically, one needs to multiply the ciphertexts, \(c_1 \cdot c_2\). This is the encryption
  of \(m_1+m_2\):
    <p>

  \( \style{text-align:right;} {
    \begin{align*}
      c_1 \cdot c_2 = (g^{m_1}) \cdot (rl^N) \cdot (g^{m_2}) \cdot (r2^N) \; \text{mod} \;
      N^2 = (g^{m_1+m_2}) \cdot (r^N) \; \text{mod} \; N^2
    \end{align*}
  } \)

  <p>
  and thus decrypts to \(m_1+m_2\). The addition is inherently modulo \(N\)
  (since \(g^N \equiv 1 \; \text{mod} \; N^2\)), but considering the size of \(N\), this is no
  practical boundary. </p>


  <h3 id="gh">c) Gentry and Halevi - Fully Homomorphic Encryption Scheme</h3>

  <p>The fully homomorphic encryption scheme by <a target="_blank"
  href="https://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-shaih/fhe-implementation.pdf">
  Gentry and Halevi</a> is a variant on the scheme by <a target="_blank"
  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120723124513/https://www.info.unicaen.fr/M2-AMI/articles-2009-2010/smart.pdf">Smart and Vercauteren</a>
  which in its turn is a variant on the original scheme as proposed by <a target="_blank"
  href="http://kddlab.zjgsu.edu.cn:7200/web/research/PrivacySecurity/344-stocdhe.pdf">
  Gentry</a>. To fully explain the scheme is too extensive for this text, so a short version for
  understanding the idea is given: The scheme uses principal ideal lattices over a ring of
  polynomials modulo \(f(x) = x^n + 1\), where \(n\) is a power of 2. As additional requirement,
  the Hermite Normal Form (HNF) of the lattice must be in a specific form such that it can be
  represented by two integers.
  <br>
  In the key-generation phase, one chooses a random degree \(N-1\) polynomial \(v(x)\). This
  polynomial yields a rotation basis \(V\) which describes the lattice to be used. The HNF of this
  lattice must be so such that the matrix representation, i.e. the basis vectors in the columns,
  should equal the identity matrix except for the leftmost column. This column has as entries the
  determinant of the lattice and all powers of a certain root \(r\) of \(f(x)\), modulo \(d\). Next,
  one computes the scaled inverse of \(v(x)\), i.e. a polynomial \(w(x)\) such that
  \(v(x) \cdot w(x) = d \; \text{mod} \; f(x)\). Here \(d\) equals the determinant of the lattice.
  The rotation basis \(W\), which is used as part of the private key, can be calculated out of the
  vector \(w(x)\). In principle, one now has all the ingredients for an encryption scheme.
  The public key in this case is the HNF of the lattice, denoted by \(B\). The private key consists
  of the rotation bases \(V\) and \(W\). This scheme unfortunately is only somewhat homomorphic.
  After explaining encryption and decryption, we will explain how to fix this.
  <br>
  The message space for this scheme is only a single bit. To encrypt such a bit \(b\), one generates
  a random \(N\)-dimensional noise vector \(u\) with entries in \(\{-1,0,-1\}\). One then computes
  \(a = 2u + b \cdot e_1\) \((e_1\) denotes the vector \((1,0,...,0))\) and computes
  \(c = a \; \text{mod} \; B\). But because of the special form of the HNF, this reduces
  \(c = b + 2u(r) \; \text{mod} \; d\), where \(u(x)\) is the polynomial induced by the noise
  vector \(u\). To decrypt a ciphertext \(c\), one computes \(m = c \; \text{mod} \; V\). Now again
  because of the special form of the HNF, this reduces to computing
  \(b = (c \cdot wi \;\text{mod} \; d) \; \text{mod} \; 2\), where \(wi\) is one term of the
  polynomial \(w(x)\), which must be odd. Denote this term by \(w\). <br/>
  Because of the special form as noted above, one can represent the public key with the integers
  \(d\) and \(r\), and the private key with the integer \(w\). The scheme is only somewhat
  homomorphic because it cannot refresh its ciphertexts thus reducing the noise vector. The trick
  to do this is called bootstrapping. Basically, the scheme is able to evaluate its own decryption
  algorithm homomorphically together with some homomorphic operations. This means that the scheme
  can evaluate some operations and then refresh the ciphertext so that it again has a low error.
  Roughly the encrypter "starts" decrypting. To achieve this, a "hint" on the secret integer \(w\)
  is given. In order to achieve this without compromising security, a large set of numbers is added
  to the public key of which a sparse subset sums up to this secret \(w\). But, of course, to be
  able to evaluate the decryption algorithm, the secret must be implicitly "known". Therefore the
  vector describing the sparse subset, i.e. a vector with a 1 in the position of the vector elements
  in the subset, is encrypted and also included in the public key.
  <br>
  Now, since the secret is available homomorphically in the public key, the ciphertext can be
  refreshed and thus the scheme has become fully homomorphic. The operations for multiplication and
  addition are the same for the ciphertext. In addition, one has to refresh the ciphertext after
  every operation to ensure the scheme is still able to correctly decrypt the ciphertext.
  </p>

  <h2 id="plugin">3) Plug-in Handling Instructions</h2>

  <p>To use any of the three schemes to try the homomorphic operations, one first needs a key pair. On the left side of the screen this can be done: Follow the instructions in the wizard to generate or choose a key pair. The key can also be saved for later use. For this the plug-in requires a username and a password. The key is then stored in an encrypted file along with a description file. This is convenient for instance for the scheme by Gentry and Halevi if one wants to use higher security, since key generation takes a while in this case. <br/>
  Once a key pair has been selected, one has to choose a modulus for the operations in the case of Gentry and Halevi. The smaller the modulus, the faster the computations will be. Then one must choose the first operand, which will be encrypted. <br/>
  Now to perform homomorphic operations, two operands are necessary to perform the operation. The first operand is only required once. Then one chooses the desired operation on the left side. The second operand is requested, and the chosen operation will be performed on the two operands. This is done homomorphically, and the ciphertext result is shown. In the bottom of the screen the operations are also performed in plaintext, so the user can see what is going on. <br/>
  For additional operations, the plug-in uses the previous result instead of the first operand. When one wants to verify if the ciphertext still encrypts the result, one chooses the "Decrypt result" button on the left. <br/>
  To start over with new numbers or with a new key pair choose the appropriate buttons on the left. </p>
