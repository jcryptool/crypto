TextSetKey=In the first step you can choose the algorithm settings. First, an algorithm variant needs to be selected. You can find more about the different variants in the online help. Then also a key size needs to be selected. While smaller key sizes will lead to faster execution, larger key sizes are safer. Currently, a key size of at least 2048 is recommended to be secure. For some algorithms additional configuration options need to be made. Instead of generating a new key, you can also load an existing one. After the generation of the key, you can also export the key.
TextSetMessage=In this step, you can determine the message parts to sign. You can either write directly in the text boxes or paste the content there. For each part, which should be redacted all or nothing, a separate part needs to be used. In this step, it is also possible to load a signed message instead.
TextSignMessage=Here you can select which message parts should be redactable. There are also schemes, which do not fulfill the property "disclosure control" and therewith every message part is redactable. A third party is then allowed to remove redactable parts, without invalidating the document\'s signature. You can also load or save generated signed messages.
TextVerifyMessage=In the verify message step, the signed message from the last step is validated. As all schemes are consistent, this verification will always be successful, if you did not import a signature, which was created with another key. You can try, to export the signature here, create a new key and then import the signature again in the new message or sign message step and see what happens then.
TextRedact=In this step, you can select which of the redactable message parts should be redacted. By pressing the button to redact, the selected parts will be removed from the signature. For this operation, only the public key of the previously generated key pair is used, as redacting is a public operation.
TextVerifyRedacted=If you selected message parts for a redaction in the previous step, those were removed. Besides seeing this result, you can also see, whether the not redacted message parts do still validate under the redacted signature or not. You can save this redacted message and/or continue with the redact message step again. The redacted message can also be imported as a signed message in the new message or the sign message step!
TextViewKey=Some information about the cryptographic keys used is printed, including the type of the key, the size of it, and the encoded form of the private and public key. You can copy a value to the clipboard by clicking the value in the table.
TextViewMessage=Here the original message parts (including all already redacted parts) can be inspected. You can also see whether the respective part is redactable or not. Note that this output was saved right after the signing and is not reconstructed from the redacted message, as this is not possible. You can save the original message and/or return to the last step.
TextViewRedacted=Here the current message is displayed. You can also see whether the respective part is redactable or not. Besides that, you can save the redacted message. This saved redacted message can also be imported as a signed message in the new message or sign message step. Otherwise, you can return to the previous step.

AlgorithmSettings=Algorithm settings
SelectAlgorithmVariant=Select an algorithm variant
ContinueWithRedacting=Continue with redacting
InvalidReasons=The signature is invalid because of at least one of the following reasons: \n 1) The message was changed illegally. \n 2) The signature was changed illegally. \n 3) The public key was changed illegally or does not match the private key of the signature \n Use one of the reset buttons to return to a previous step.

Title=Redactable Signature Schemes
Description=Digital signature schemes are used to provide data integrity and data origin authentication for a signed message. A redactable signature scheme enables the attestation of a message in such a way that, if certain parts of the signed message known as fields) are redacted (erased, blanked out or permanently removed), the attestation of the redacted message with respect to its integrity and origin authentication can still be verified. More precisely, upon signing a message, the signer knowing the private signature key can define which parts of the message can later be redacted (in the sense of ISO/IEC 27038) by any entity only knowing the message, the signature, and the signer\u2019s redaction key. Any other modification of the signed message (e.g. redaction of other message parts or insertion/ modification of any parts) invalidates the attestation given by the signature.
