<h1>Number Shark</h1>


<p>The idea behind the game is to win as many numbers as possible from a given number set.
You win, if the sum of your numbers is larger than the sum of numbers of the Number Shark.
There is a maximum sum for a given number set. Your sum should be as near as possible to the maximum sum.</p>

<p>If you select an arbitrary, free number, you get this number and the Number Shark will eat all free real divisors of this number.
For example, if you select 6, the Number Shark will eat the numbers 1, 2 and 3.
If some of the divisors have been selected (by you) or eaten (by the Number Shark) before, the Number Shark will get only the remaining divisors. If there are no free divisors any more, the Number Shark will get the selected number.</p>

<p>The game originally was developed for pupils to learn the behavior of divisors and prime numbers.</p>
