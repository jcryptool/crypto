<h1>Rules of the game</h1>

<p> </br> </p>
<h4>Goal</h4>
<p>You win, if the sum of your numbers (your score) is larger than the score of the Number Shark.</p>
<p>Try to maximize your score as much as you can.
For each given number of numbers (e.g. n=20) there is a maximum score you can achieve (e.g. 124 for 20 numbers).</p>

<p> </br> </p>
<h4>Rules</h4>
<p>You always have the first turn, i.e. you are starting the first round.</p>
<p>Select an arbitrary number from the number selection area.
The Number Shark eats any real divisor of the selected number, as long as the divisors have not been used before.
Continue selecting numbers, which have not been selected by you or were eaten by the Number Shark in previous rounds.</p>
<p>Pay attention, the Number Shark always needs a number.
If you select a number without remaining free divisors, then the Number Shark will take this number and you will get nothing.
The game is over with the selection of the last free number.</p>

<p> </br> </p>
<h4>Remarks / Definitions</h4>
<p>Sample: 6 has the real divisors 1, 2, 3.
<br>Primes like 19 have as real divisors only themselves and the 1.</p>
<p>Initially, all numbers are <strong>free</strong>.</p>
<p>If you selected a number or if the Number Shark ate it, we say the number is <strong>used</strong>.</p>
<p>In each <strong>round</strong> you select a number and the Number Shark eats its divisors.</p>
