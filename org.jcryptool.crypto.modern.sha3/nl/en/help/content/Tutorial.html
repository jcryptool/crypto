	<h1>SHA-3 Candidates</h1>

	<p>The JCT menu <strong><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.core.help/$nl$/help/users/algorithms/toc.html">Algorithms</a> → Hash → SHA-3 Candidates</strong> has the following entries:<p>

<table>
    <tbody>

        <tr>
          <td><a href="./JHTutorial.html">JH</a></td>
          <td>JH</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><a href="./ECHOTutorial.html">ECHO</a></td>
          <td>ECHO</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><a href="./SkeinTutorial.html">Skein</a></td>
          <td>Skein</td>
        </tr>

	<h2>About SHA-3</h2>

	<p>The Secure Hash Algorithm is a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) (see <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithm">Wikipedia</a>). 
	In 2012, the NIST has chosen the hash function Keccak as SHA-3 and thus successor of the SHA-1/2 family.</p>
	
	<p>JCrypTool implemented three of candidates that achieved the second round of the SHA-3 selection process.</p>

	<p>More information about these algorithms is available on the sub sites.</p>




	<h2>Usage of the dialog</h2>
	
	<p>While the dialogs for MD5 and SHA-256 don't need any input and just write their output to the hexeditor within JCT, the dialog for the SHA-3 candidates has more options.</p>
	
	<p>After choosing the algorithm and the wished bitlength in the dialog for the SHA-3 candidates, you can determine whether you want to create a hash value or verify a hash value. In case you create a hash value there are two ways where to place the output. ECHO has the additional option to salt the algorithm (with 32 hex characters).</p>


		<h3>Generate hash</h3>

		<p>The hash is generated always out of the content of the active editor.</p>
		
		<p>The output is placed in one the following two mediums:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Hexeditor:</b> Displays the hash value in a hex editor.</li>
		<li><b>Texteditor:</b> Displays the hash value as hex values in a text editor (blocked in groups of 2).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>By clicking on the <b>Finish</b> button the hash value will be generated.</p>



		<h3>Verify hash</h3>
		
		<p>A new hash value is generated from the editor content. This new hash value is compared with a given hash value to be entered in the SHA-3 dialog. Both hash values (the given and the generated one) and also the result of the comparison are shown as output in a new text editor tab.</p>
		
		<p>When selecting the option <b>Verify Hash</b>, a new field is available to enter the given hash value.</p>
		
		<p>By clicking on the <b>Finish</b> button the verification will be started.</p>
