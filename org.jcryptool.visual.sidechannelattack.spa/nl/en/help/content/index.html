<h1>Simple Power Analysis(SPA) against RSA</h1>

<p>
  Simple power analysis (SPA) involves analysing power traces or graphs of electrical activity
  in cryptographic devices such as smartcards, integrated curcuits, CPUs, etc.
  The goal is to extract secrets from the devices using the information about the electrical
  activity.
</p>

<h2>Insecure "Square and Multiply" algorithm explanation</h2>

<p>The "Square and Multiply" algorithm is used to calculate the exponentiation of large numbers in an efficient manner. 
This is needed in the RSA algorithm in which encryption and decryption takes place by exponantiation of
the plain text/cipher text with the public or private key. These exponents are in most cases more
than 2000 bit long.
</p>

<p>
  The algorithm is based on the principle of nested exponentiation. For example, \(2^{2^{2^2}}\) is
  the same as \(2^8\), because the powers get multiplied and \(2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2\) equals \(8\).
  As this binary exponentiation (a simple duplication each time) grows very quickly (\(2^{30}\) is
  already greater than a billion) it is possible to process very large exponents within a few 100
  rounds.

  <code style="background-color: #eee;border: 1px solid #999;display: block;padding: 10px;">
  c     - type: integer base of the exponential calculation
  power - type: integer exponent or power
  n     - type: integer divisor for the modulo operation
  
  Operators:
  >> - right shift
  &  - logical and
  %  - modulo remainder
  
  def unsafe_square_and_multiply(c, power, n):
      res = 1
      while power > 0:               # iterate over the power's bits as long as its not 0
          res = (res * res) % n      # 'square' step
          b = power & 1              # determine the power's lowest bit by a logical and with 1 and power
          if b == 1:
              res = (res * c) % n    # If the bit is a one, do a 'multiply' step
          power = power >> 1         # Shift the power one bit to the right, to advance to the next round
      return  res       
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
This is how it works: the base concept is to iterate over the bits of the exponent (variable
<b>power</b>) from the lowest to the highest one. For each step we square a temporary variable
<b>res</b>, which is the first part of the algorithms name. Then the bit of the exponent is taken
into account: if it is a 0 nothing is done, if it is a 1, the temporary <b>res</b> is multiplied
with the base <b>c</b> (multiply step).
The next bit is then shifted to the right. This means the current bit is discarded and the next one
takes its place. If the number is 0 there are no more bits left and the algorithm is finished.
</p>

<p>
 <b>Note:</b> there are many variants and variations of this algorithm. This one uses bit operations
 and is written in Python. You can copy it to a Python interpreter and try it out.

<h2>RSA parameter explanation</h2>

<p>
  Within the plug-in you can select the parameters of an RSA decryption operation, which is used as
example.

<p>Ciphertext \(c\) (e.g. \(5454\)) which shall be decrypted by the secret exponent \(d\)
(e.g. \(101\)).</p>

<p>\(P\) and \(Q\) are two coprime numbers and the module \(n = P \cdot Q\).</p>

<p>
  \(R = c^d \; \text{mod} \; n\) is the decrypted plaintext, the output of the "Square andMultiply"
  algorithm.

<h2>SPA against RSA demonstration</h2>

<p>
  Since the presence of the if statement in the algorithm, "Square and Multiply" is vulnerable to
  "Power Analysis Attack".
</p>

<img width="85%" src="simple-sam-power-graph.svg">

<p>
  The power traces between "squaring and multiplication" and "squaring" are different.
  "Simple Power Analysis" can recover every bit of the secure private key \(d\) through comparison
  and analysis of the power traces in each turn. As shown in the figure above, the private key is
  1100101.
</p>

<h2>Secure improved "Square and Multiply always" algorithm explanation</h2>

<p>
  The original "Square and Multiply" algorithm could be improved by adding a dummy
  multiplication operation in the branch of bit "0". It generates a comparable activity in the
  cryptographic device and the result can be discarded.
</p>

  <code style="background-color: #eee;border: 1px solid #999;display: block;padding: 10px;">
  c     - type: integer base of the exponential calculation
  power - type: integer exponent or power
  n     - type: integer divisor for the modulo operation
  
  Operators:
  >> - right shift
  &  - locigal and
  %  - modulo remainder
  
  def square_and_multiply(c, power, n):
      res = 1
      while power > 0:               # iterate over the power's bits as long as its not 0
          res = (res * res) % n      # 'square' step
          b = power & 1              # determine the power's lowest bit by a logical and with 1 and power
          if b == 1:
              res = (res * c) % n    # If the bit is a one, do a 'multiply' step
          else:
              tmp = (res * c) % n    # If the bit is a zero, do a dummy multiplication and discard its result
          power = power >> 1         # Shift the power one bit to the right, to advance to the next round
      return  res       
  </code>
</pre>

<p>Note how in the secure output in the right column, there is always a multiply operation</p>

<img width="85%" src="processofsama.PNG">

<p>
  No matter the current bit is "1" or "0", squaring and multiplication operation will always
  be carried out.
</p>

<img width="85%" src="secure-sam-power-graph.svg">

<p>
  Obviously, there are no more distinguished difference between the branches of bit "1" and bit "0",
  so recovering each bit of private key by comparison the power traces using SPA is no more
  feasible.
