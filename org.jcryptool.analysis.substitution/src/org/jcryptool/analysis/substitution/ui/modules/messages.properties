StatisticsSelector_0=<no predefined statistics available for the selected alphabet>
StatisticsSelector_1=Select precalculated statistics:
StatisticsSelector_2=Analyze custom reference text:
StatisticsSelector_4=It is recommended to do this, because the ciphertext should consist of a set of characters very similar to that of the reference text, to 
StatisticsSelector_5=guarantee the usefulness of the generated statistic. For example, when analyzing a ciphertext that is only in uppercase letter, one should replace all lowercase characters in the reference text with uppercase letters before analyzing it.
StatisticsSelector_6=Language: %s | %s
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_0=Optionally, you can go to the second wizard page (using the "Next >" button), to apply generic text transformations like white space filtering, or upper-/lowercase transformation.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_10=Ciphertext
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_11=Please select a ciphertext
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_12=Alphabet
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_13=The alphabet which contains the characters of the encrypted text is selected automatically.\r\nBecause the statistical data is calculated based on which characters appear in the alphabet, you may want to fine-tune.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_14=Alphabet:
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_15=Statistical data from reference text
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_16=For the analysis, some reference statistics (frequency of single characters, 2-grams and 3-grams) of a typical text are needed.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_18=Every language is different: You should select a reference, which matches the language of the ciphertext. If you don't find your language in the predefined statistics set, please specify a custom reference text.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_19=Analysis
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_20=The configuration is now complete; Start the analysis of the ciphertext by clicking on the button below.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_22=If you want to reset all the settings in this window, or return to this page from the analysis, please click on the button "Start the analysis over" in the upper right corner in the toolbar of this view.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_23=Start the analysis
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_8=Parameters for the substitution analysis
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_9=For the analysis, you need to provide the following information:
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_0=Substitution analysis
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_1=Letter frequency statistics
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_10=Plaintext to cipher substitution:
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_12=<The mappings in the mappings editor were not completely filled out>
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_13=Load another reference statistic
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_2=Mapping of each alphabet character
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_3=Preview of the deciphered text
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_4=The substitution analysis consists of figuring out, which characters in the ciphertext have to be replaced by which former plaintext characters.\r\nThe statistics of the reference text (RT) and the ciphertext (CT) help you with that. Single characters/pairs/triplets with similar frequencies very possible correspond to each other. Try to substitute these reference characters with their corresponding ciphertext characters in the substitution editor below, and observe how the plaintext (PT) changes.
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_5=Open the plaintext in a new editor
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_6=Fill in missing characters
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_7=Export the character mappings as string
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_8=Cipher to plaintext substitution:
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_9=Reset the character mappings
SubstitutionKeyEditor_8=
SubstitutionKeyEditor_9=
SubstKeyViewer_0=Substitution as string
TextLoadController_0=Load text...
TextLoadController_1=Loaded text:
