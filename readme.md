JCrypTool Crypto
=======

The **JCrypTool Crypto** repository contains all crypto plug-ins for JCrypTool: **Algorithms** (classic, modern and XML Security), **Analysis**, **Games** and **Visualizations**. Basic crypto features are included in this repository too.

These projects require the plug-ins from the [JCrypTool Core](https://github.com/jcryptool/core) repository to compile and to run.
