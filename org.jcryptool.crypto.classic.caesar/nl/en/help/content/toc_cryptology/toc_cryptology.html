<h1>Caesar Cipher</h1>
<p>
	The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his generals.
</p>


<h3 id="classification">Classification</h3>
<p>
	The Caesar cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

<h4>Encryption</h4>

<p>At the Caesar cipher, every character of the text is replaced by a character k positions far away in the alphabet. This “shift“ k is the key, which is often not written as a number, but as a character of the alphabet. The key k as a number is then the position of this
character in the alphabet (1-relative).</p>

<p>Since the Caesar cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution, it can also be described with a substitution alphabet. This substitution alphabet is of course just rotated by k. An example will describe it best. For k = 4 (and the standard Latin uppercase alphabet):</p>

<p>Every character in the plaintext is substituted by the character which is at the same position in the ciphertext alphabet. </p>

<p>Example of an encryption:</p>

<p><i>Plaintext:</i> “CHIFFRE”; key: “D” (means k=4)</p>

<p><i>Encryption result:</i> „GLMJJVI“ (C+4 = <b>G</b>, H+4 = <b>L</b>, …; substitution alphabet example from above fits, too)</p>



<h4>Decryption</h4>

<p>The decryption is done naturally by shifting the characters back up the alphabet by the amount k. Systematically, an inverse key i to k is created, with i = length(Alphabet) – k, and for decryption, the ciphertext is “encrypted” with i.</p>
