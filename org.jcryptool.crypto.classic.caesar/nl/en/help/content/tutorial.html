<h1>Caesar Usage</h1>

<p>This page explains the user interface for the Caesar cipher. For further information about the Caesar algorithm itself, see the sub page: <a href="toc_cryptology/toc_cryptology.html">Caesar Cipher</a>.</p>

<p>Below, the different "groupings" for the options and parameters in the wizard are explained. In the Caesar wizard, the groupings "Key" and "Operation" are the most important ones..</p>


<h3>Operation &ndash; encryption or decryption</h3>
<p>First, choose, whether you want to en- or decrypt the text in this dialog. As this is a symmetric cipher, a text encrypted with a certain key can be decrypted to the original text, using the same key.</p>


<h3>Alphabet</h3>
<p>The alphabet, over which a cryptographic operation (like en- or decryption) is executed, holds all the characters that this operation will accept and process. Use the "Show alphabet" button to see, which characters the selected alphabet contains.</p>

<p>For example, if you choose an alphabet that holds only UPPERCASE characters (like "Upper Latin (A-Z)"), lowercase characters will not be encrypted. With the checkbox "Filter non-alphabet characters", you can choose whether just to neglect (unchecked), or to completely delete those characters, which would be all lowercase characters in the example.


<h3>Pre-operation text transformation</h3>
<p>If you would like to change the input text before you apply the algorithm, you can check this box, and you will be able to select from a range of text-altering operations after completing this wizard page. For example, you can delete all blanks for increased security.</p>

<p>Pre-operation text transformation should only be used when encrypting a text. When used with decryption, there will be information loss or unreadable text in most cases.</p>


<h3>Key</h3>
<p>The Key of the Caesar cipher always consists of exactly one character. This characters is specifying the amount of shift of the whole text down the alphabet by its position of occurrence in the alphabet. Thus, only keys are allowed, that: <b><br /> - consist of one character <br /> - are contained in the alphabet chosen above.</b></p>

<p>After finishing the wizard, you should be able to see your en- or decrypted text in the newly opened editor.</p>
