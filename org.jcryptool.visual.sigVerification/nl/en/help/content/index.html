  <h1>Signature Verification</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to the online help of the Signature Verification plug-in. Below, you find an overview of the
    plug-in and a more detailed description of each step of the signature verification process. Please click
    to skip the first part and scroll forward to the help for the <a href="#GUI2">Verification of
      certificates using the shell validity model.</a> <br> This visualization shows the verification process
    of a signature of a signed document. A digital signature ensures the authenticity of the sender and the
    integrity of the sent document.

  <h2>Step 1 – Choose input</h2>
  <p>In order to start the verification process, click the button "Choose input". Select an existing
    signed file, that has been created using the "Signature Demonstration" visualization. The maximum file
    size is shown at the top of the window. If you don't own a signed file yet, feel free to create one using
    the "Signature Demonstration" visualization.</p>

  alt="Dialogue to load a signature. A file can be chosen with the Browse button. There
  are the buttons Finish and Cancel at the bottom.">

  <h2>Step 2 – Choose hash method</h2>
  <p>The second step of the signature verification process is to calculate the message digest or hash
    value of the document. A hash function is an algorithm or subroutine that maps data sets of variable
    length to data sets of a fixed length (digest). Signing the message digest rather than the documents (the
    message or the file) improves the efficiency of the process because the message digest is usually much
    smaller in size than the document. The same hash algorithm used by the creator of the digital signature
    must be used by the verifier of a digital signature. Usually, the signature contains some information
    about the used algorithm. Here, the user has to choose the correct algorithm, manually.</p>

  <h3>Description of provided hash functions</h3>
  <h4>MD5</h4>
  <p>The MD5 algorithm (published in 1992 and specified in RFC 1321) takes as input a message of arbitrary
    length and produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest". The MD5 algorithm is intended
    for digital signature applications, where a large file must be "compressed" in a secure manner before
    being encrypted with a private key under a public-key cryptosystem such as RSA.</p>

  <h4>SHA-1</h4>
  <p>The “Secure Hash Algorithm“ (published in 1995 by the United States NIST) computes a condensed
    representation of a message or a data file. When a message of any length \(\lt 2^{64}\) bits is input, the
    SHA-1 produces a 160-bit output. The SHA-1 has the word "secure" in its name because it was at the
    time of its invention computationally infeasible to find a message which corresponds to a given
    message digest, or to find two different messages which produce the same message digest.</p>

  <h4>SHA-256</h4>
  <p>SHA-256 is one of the successor hash functions to SHA-1 (collectively referred to as SHA-2), and is
    one of the strongest hash functions available. While SHA-1 has not been compromised in real-world
    conditions (however in theory), SHA-256 is not much more complex to code. It is recommended to use this
    method instead of SHA-1.</p>
  <h4>SHA-384</h4>
  <p>SHA-384 is like SHA-512, but they differ in the size of the hash value (SHA-384 is truncated). The
    initial hash is calculated from the 64 decimal bits of the square roots of the consecutive primes (23, 29,
    etc.). In the end only the first six 64-bit words from the result are used. The attached number indicates
    the length of each hash value (in bits).</p>
  <h4>SHA-512</h4>
  <p>SHA-256 and SHA-512 differ in the word size. SHA-256 uses 32-bit words where SHA-512 uses 64-bit
    words. The attached number indicates the length of each hash value (in bits).</p>

  <h2>Step 3 – Verify signature</h2>
  <p>To verify your signed message, you now need to select the signature function that was used to sign
    it.</p>

  <img src="Signaturmethode.png" style="width: 50%; min-width: 500px; max-width: 800px"
  alt="A wizard with choices for the signature method. These are DSA, RSA, ECDSA and
  'RSA and MGF1'. Below is the possibility to select a key. At the bottom are buttons Finish and Cancel">

  <h3>Description of provided signature functions</h3>
  <h4>DSA</h4>
  <p>The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) (published by the NIST in 1991) is a United States Federal
    Government standard for digital signatures. With DSA, the entropy, secrecy, and uniqueness of the random
    signature value is critical. It is so critical that violating any one of those three requirements can
    reveal the entire private key to an attacker. Using the same value twice (even while keeping random
    signature value secret), using a predictable value, or leaking even a few bits of random signature value
    in each of several signatures, is enough to break DSA.</p>
  <p>
    To learn more about DSA: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm" target="_blank">Visit DSA on
      Wikipedia</a>
  </p>
  <h4>RSA</h4>
  <p>RSA (the algorithm was published in 1977) is an algorithm for public-key cryptography that is based
    on the presumed difficulty of factoring large integers, the factoring problem. Anyone can use the public
    key to encrypt a message, but with currently published methods, if the public key is large enough, only
    someone with knowledge of the prime factors can feasibly decode the message. Secure padding schemes such
    as RSA-PSS are as essential for the security of message signing as they are for message encryption. The
    PKCS #1 cryptography standard provides recommendations for the implementation of public-key cryptography
    based on the RSA algorithm.</p>

      JCT-RSA</a>
  </p>
  <h4>ECDSA</h4>
  <p>The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) (proposed in 1992 by Scott Vanstone) is the
    elliptic curve analog of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). Unlike the ordinary discrete logarithm
    problem and the integer factorization problem, no sub exponential-time algorithm is known for the elliptic
    curve discrete logarithm problem. The size of a private key that is considered secure is much smaller with
    ECDSA. At a security level of 80 bits, meaning an attacker requires the equivalent of about \(2^{80}\) signature
    generations to find the private key, the size of a DSA public key is at least 1024 bits, whereas the size
    of an ECDSA public key would be 160 bits.</p>
  <h4>RSA and MGF1</h4>
  <p>A Mask Generation Function (MGF) is a function to generate pseudo random numbers of variable length.
    It's practically impossible to tell the random number without any knowledge about the starting
    value(seed). MGF1 is a method specified within the PKCS#1 which uses hash methods like SHA-1 to create
    pseudo random numbers.</p>

  <h1 id="GUI2">Certificate validation using the shell model</h1>
  <p>This user interface was included for learning purposes. It shows how the validity dates of the
    different certificates affect the result of the shell model validation. In the menu "Visuals ->
    Certificate verification", you can find a more comprehensive visualization with 3 validity models, in
    which you can adjust the dates with sliders.</p>

  <p align=center>
    <img src="2ob.png" style="width: 90%; min-width:500px; max-width: 1200px"
    alt="Screenshot of 2nd tab Validity according to the chain model. It shows 3 levels of certificates:
    root, level 2 and user certificates. There is a input field for a start and end date for each.
    At the bottom a red X or green checkmark shows the validity. ">
  </p>

  <h2>Shell model</h2>
  <p>The shell model validation only succeeds if all certificates are valid at the time of the
    verification. I.e. if the user certificate and the level 2 certificate are valid at the time of the
    verification but the root certificate is not, the signature is considered invalid. At the same time, lower
    certificates are not allowed to have a longer validity period than those of a higher level(e.g.: Level 2
    compared to root).</p>
  <h3>Certificates</h3>
  <h4>Root certificate</h4>
  <p>Highest certificate level. Determines validity of following certificates.</p>
  <h4>Level 2 certificate</h4>
  <p>Signed with the root certificate.</p>
  <h4>User certificate</h4>
  <p>Certificate of the lowest level. In order for it to be valid all higher certificates (in this case
    root and level 2 certificate) have to be considered valid.</p>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <h4>New validity dates</h4>
  <p>This enables you to change the validity dates of all certificates. In order to see the new results,
    press the button "Recalculate".</p>
  <h4>Reset the dates of the 3 certificates</h4>
  <p>Restores the default certificates, which were created by first opening the 2nd user interface.</p>
  <h4>Recalculate</h4>
  <p>Starts the recalculation according to the shell model. If the certificates are still valid, you will
    see a green tick. If not, you will see a red cross. Please note that this button is only enabled if all
    given dates are real valid dates.</p>
