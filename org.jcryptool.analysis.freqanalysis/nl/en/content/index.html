<h1>The Frequency Analysis</h1>
<p>The Frequency Analysis basically counts the occurrence of all characters the text consists of. The text provided is visualized as a graph depicting the percental frequency of characters. Options to perform further analysis are given such as adding Vigen&eacute;re parameters or a text overlay.</p>

<p>You can use this plug-in in two ways, depending on what you want to do with the frequency distribution:</p>

<p>1) The <b>simple view</b> (radio button "Simply give me a diagram") shows you a graph with the percental occurrences. You have the option to alter the text before analyzing it by clicking the button "Filter settings" (filter characters, transforming all characters to lower case, etc.).</p>

<p>The <b>Properties</b> section offers configuring the frequency analysis by choosing a monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic analysis. Monoalphabetic means that there is a single substitution over the whole text, while polyalphabetic means that there are multiple substitutions over the text. When choosing polyalphabetic, the option to configure <b>Vigen&eacute;re settings </b> is given. The <b>Key length</b> can be configured which is the distance between repeated groups of cipher-letters, as multiple plaintext letters can correspond to a ciphertext letter in Vigen&eacute;re ciphers. The <b>offset</b> allows to configure the offset of characters in the alphabet.</p>

<p>2) The <b>extended view</b> (radio button "Add more complex analysis abilities") offers more analysis abilities, which are located in the second tab in the properties area:</p>
<p>The <b>Decipher and Overlay</b> tab offers more analysis tools. The first option offered is to <b>"overlay" a reference distribution</b>. This will be semi-transparent, and can be useful in many ways. You can choose a reference text from which the distribution is calculated in the drop down menu below.</p>
<p>The next option is <b>on which character set</b> (alphabet) the reference distribution is displayed. If you only want to see what is the usual distribution of capital letters over a text as overlay, select the corresponding alphabet "Upper Latin".<br/>
<b>Important:</b> This option is adjusting itself correctly on ciphertexts normally.</p>

<p>The third tab labeled <b>Loaded text</b> shows information about the text: the name of the source, the number of characters, as well as a short excerpt.</p>
