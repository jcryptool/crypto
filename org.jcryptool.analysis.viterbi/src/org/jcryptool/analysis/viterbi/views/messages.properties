DetailsComposite_0=In this tab, for each step (and character) in the result sequences, the competing sequences above the specified "search depth" limit are displayed on the left. These candidates and their probabilities display the selected state's guess about which paths are most probable according to the ciphertext and the decisions of the previous steps. \nEach step is based on the previous one\: The candidates of a latter step are generated by trying out all possible characters appended to the paths from the former step. The "highlight" mechanism enables you to trace one competitor over all steps. Just select a path from the left table and click the "highlight" button to show every path across all steps that relates (predecessor or a successor) to the highlighted one. The online help offers further explanation and examples.

ViterbiComposite_description=The Viterbi algorithm is a complex variant of a frequency analysis. Depending on the probabilities of the single characters it reveals both plaintexts.\r\nThe function can be summarized as follows (this is just a short explanation of the algorithm)\:\r\n1.\tA character will be disassembled in all possible combinations.\r\n\tIf you use XOR, you are inverting this process with another XOR. The modular addition is inverted with a modular subtraction.\r\n2.\tThe probability of all combinations is calculated. For these calculations you need a complex language model to consider longer character sequences.\r\n\tTo get a proper solution you also have to take the preceding characters into account.\r\n3. The probabilities for combinations are stored in an ordered manner. Unlikely combinations are not investigated further.
