<h1>Substitution Cipher</h1>

<p>
	The (monoalphabetic) substitution cipher replaces each letter in the text with another, based on a ciphertext alphabet (generated from a keyword).

	(Monoalphabetic) substitution itself is one of the basic cryptographic algorithm classes.

<h4>Encryption</h4>

<p>The monoalphabetic substitution replaces (substitutes) letters from the plaintext, a, with letters from the ciphertext alphabet, a‘. Every letter a has exactly one mapped a’, and every a’ is mapped to a letter a from the plaintext alphabet at most once. Thus, it is a bijective mapping, and can be defined, based on the plaintext alphabet, by specifying a
substitution alphabet, which can have equal or more elements than the plaintext alphabet. The character at index m of the plaintext alphabet will always be mapped to the character at index m of the substitution alphabet. Such, the substitution alphabet is the key of the monoalphabetic substitution.</p>

<p>Writing down a whole alphabet is unhandy, so the substitution alphabet is generated from a key string in most cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>The keyword may only contain characters from the substitution alphabet</li>

<li>Multiple occurrences of characters are removed – each character may only occur once.</li>

<li>Fill up the key word with characters from the plaintext alphabet (append) until the necessary length (the length of the plaintext alphabet) is reached.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now an example: The word “SECRET” has to be encrypted with the keyword “KEY”. Below are the alphabets – in this notation it becomes clear how the substitution mapping works – replace each character from the first row with the one below it in the second row).</p>

<p>The encrypted word is „WIGVIX“.</p>


<h4>Decryption</h4>

<p>At the decryption, the substitution mapping is inverted. It’s also possible to be defined as encryption with the former plaintext alphabet, taking the former substitution alphabet as actual plaintext alphabet.
In the scheme above, all characters from the second row would be replaces with
the ones above them (first row).</p>
