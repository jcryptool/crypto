    <description>The <b>Magic Door</b> scenario is an easy to understand example for a zero knowledge proof. Here Alice wants to prove to Bob that she knows the secret code for the door between two rooms (marked with &apos;Left&apos; and &apos;Right&apos;). But she does not want to disclose any information about the secret itself to Bob or any third party.</description>

    <description>This mathematical protocol is designed to prove to Bob that Alice knows a secret without revealing it. It runs in the number space that is build up on the modulo n field, with n being the product of two prime numbers, p and q. P and q are only known to Alice and must not be made public.</description>

It runs in the number space that is build up on the modulo n field, with n being the product of two prime numbers, p and q. P and q are only known to Alice and must not be made public. Feige Fiat Shamir is an improved Fiat Shamir protocol which is less vulnerable to attacks, meaning that the chance of guessing the right numbers for an attacker is not 50% but 6.25%.</description>
