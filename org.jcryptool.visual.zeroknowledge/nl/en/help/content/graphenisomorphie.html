<h1>Graph Isomorphism</h1>

<h2>Intention</h2>
<p>
	Alice wants to prove to Bob that she knows an isomorphism \(f\), which
	transforms the graph \(G_0\) to \(G_1\) without revealing her secret
	\(f\) or parts of it.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	Alice chooses a random bit a (\(0\) or \(1\)) and creates a new isomorphism \(g\)
	which results in the graph \(H\) when calculating \(g(G_a)\).
	She sends \(H\) to Bob.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p>
		Bob also chooses randomly a bit \(b\) (\(0\) or \(1\)) and sends it to Alice. She
		should now provide Bob with an isomorphism \(h\) which equates to:
	</p>
	
		\( \style{text-align:left;} {
		\begin{align*}
			H = h(G_b)
		\end{align*}
		} \)
		
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p>If \(a = b\) then the equation</p>
	
		\( \style{text-align:left;} {
		\begin{align*}
			g(G_b) = H = h(G_b)
		\end{align*}
		} \)
		
	<p>holds true, therefore Alice can just send her before generated isomorphism \(g\) to Bob.</p>
	
	<p>
		If \(a \neq b\) then Alice can not simply just send \(g\) to Bob because the two
		isomorphisms must be different (\(g(G_a) = H = g(G_b)\)
		can never be true when \(G_a \neq G_b\)).
		She is also not able to calculate an isomorphism \(h\) which translates
		\(G_b\) to \(H\) because this is a NP-hard problem.
		But Alice knows an isomorphism \(f\) from \(G_0\) to \(G_1\), therefore she can
		apply this to get \(f(G_b) = G_a \quad \text{ when}\ a \neq b\).
		By using this knowledge she can create the desired isomorphism with
	</p>
	
	\( \style{text-align:left;} {
		\begin{align*}
			g(G_b) = H = h(G_b)
		\end{align*}
		} \)
	
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<p>Bob receives \(h\) and verifies \(H = h(G_b)\).</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Vulnerability</h2>
<p>
Carol, the attacker, does not know the isomorphism \(f\) which translates
\(G_0\) to \(G_1\) and vice versa. Therefore she would not be able to provide
Bob with an isomorphism \(h\) if \(a \neq b\) holds true (see point 3 in the
protocol flow for calculating \(h\) when \(a \neq b\)).
But if \(a = b\) then \(h\) would be the same isomorphism like \(g\), which she
can create by herself. This concludes that she can successfully answer
Bob's request only if she guessed the same bit like he did.
</p>

<p>
The probability of this, with two valid bit values \((0\) and \(1)\), is \(50\,\%\).
By running ten consecutive iterations we have a chance to deceive Bob
of less than \(0.1\,\%\) \((0.5^{10})\). Considering \(2^{80}\) as minimum security level for
cryptographic operations, \(80\) iterations would be necessary. 
</p>

<p>
By clicking on the <b>run several times</b> button in the main interface,
a protocol run with adjustable number of iterations can be simulated
from provers and attackers view.
