<h1>Magic Door</h1>

<h2>Intention</h2>
<p>
The Magic Door scenario is an easy to understand example for a zero
knowledge proof. Here Alice wants to prove to Bob that she knows the
secret code for the door between two rooms (marked with <b>Left</b> and
<b>Right</b>). But she does not want to disclose any information about
the secret itself to Bob or any third party.
</p>

<h2>Appliance</h2>
<p>
Alice decides randomly on a room and enters it. Bob does not know
which room Alice chooses, but he knows that once she entered the room
the only way to change to the other room is by knowing the secret
code between the security door of the two adjacent rooms.
</p>

<p>
Bob then also decides randomly on one room and stands in front of it.
Alice knows which room Bob has chosen (because she can see him through a one-way window)
and now has to leave through the door of his choice.
</p>

<p>
Now there are two possible situations applicable:
<ol>
	<li>Alice is already in the room Bob has chosen, she only has to
leave the room through the door she came in.
	</li>
	<li>Alice is in the other room; she has to change rooms through the
security door. As she knows the secret code she is able to do so
and can come out through the door Bob has chosen.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
In both situations the zero knowledge protocol is successful. Alice
did show to Bob that she knows the secret code without sharing any
information about the code itself.
</p>

<h2>Vulnerability</h2>
<p>
Carol, the attacker, wants to deceive Bob by pretending to know
the secret code of the security door without actually possessing it.
She has a mathematical chance of 50% to guess the same room like
Bob, therefore a single round of the protocol is not sufficient to
ensure with a satisfying probability that the prover really knows
the secret code.
Therefore in a practical appliance of this protocol, several rounds
have to be iterated consecutively. The chance for deceiving Bob
will exponentially decrease with the number of iterations.
</p>

<p>
Chance to deceive Bob without knowledge of the secret:
chance \(= p^k\), with \(p = \) probability and \(k = \) number of iterations.
</p>

<p>
For the Magic Door protocol we have \(p = 0.5\). By running ten consecutive
iterations we have a chance to deceive Bob of less than \(0.1\,\%\) \((0.5^{10})\).
Considering \(2^{80}\) as minimum security level for
cryptographic operations, \(80\) iterations would be necessary.
</p>

<p>
By clicking on the "run several times" button in the main interface,
a Magic Door protocol with adjustable iterations can be simulated
from provers and attackers view.
