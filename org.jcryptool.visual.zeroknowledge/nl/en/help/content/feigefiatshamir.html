	<h1>Feige Fiat Shamir Protocol</h1>

	<h2>Intention</h2>

	<p>This mathematical protocol is designed to prove to Bob that Alice
	knows a secret without revealing it. It runs in the number space
	that is build up on the modulo \(n\) field, with \(n\) being the product of
	two prime numbers, \(p\) and \(q\). These two numbers are only known
	to Alice and must not be made public.
	Feige Fiat Shamir is an improved Fiat Shamir protocol which is less
	vulnerable to attacks, meaning that the chance of guessing the right
	numbers for an attacker is not 50% but 6.25%.</p>

	<h2>Appliance</h2>
	<p>Alice creates a set of numbers \(s_1,s_2,...,s_k\) with \(\gcd(s_x, n) = 1\)
	and calculates corresponding numbers \(v_x = s_x^2 \mod n\).
	This plugin allows secrets with a lengh up to 4 (\(1 \leq k \leq 4\)).
	The numbers \(s_x\) are secret whereby
	the numbers \(v_x\) are public and known by Bob.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>For the iterations she chooses a randomly generated number \(r\) in the
		same number space and calculates \(x = r^2 \mod n\).
		\(x\) is sent to Bob.</li>

		<li>Bob then chooses random bits \((b_1,...,b_k)\),
		which are either 0 or 1 and sends them to Alice.</li>

		<li>Alice calculates \(y \equiv r \cdot s_1^{b_1} s_2^{b_2}\ ...\ s_k^{b_k} \mod n\)
		and sends the result to Bob.</li>

		<li>Bob checks if
		\(y^2 \equiv x \cdot v_1^{b_1} v_2^{b_2}\ ...\ v_k^{b_k} \mod n\) holds true.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>If the equation holds, one iteration of the protocol is a success.</p>

	<h2>Vulnerability</h2>
	<p> The attacker Carol does not know \(s\). She can try to feign the possesion of \(s\)
	to Bob. To achieve this she:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>eavesdrops the public vector \(v\).</li>
	<li>randomly selects a \(\ y \mod n\)</li>
	<li>guesses, which \(b\) Bob will send her. Using this, she calculates \(x\) as 
	\(x = y^2 \cdot v_1^{-b_1} \cdot v_2^{-b_2}\ \cdot\ ...\ \cdot\ v_k^{-b_k} \mod n\)</li>
	<li>sends \(x\) to Bob</li>
	<li>receives \(b\) from Bob. Because Carol already had to guess it in step 3,
	it is not important anymore.</li>
	<li>send \(y\) to Bob. If she guessed \(b\) correctly, Bob will receive a correct result, since: 
	
	\begin{alignat}{3}
	y^2 &\equiv x & \cdot v_1^{b_1} &\cdot v_2^{b_2}\ &\ ...\ &v_k^{b_k} &\mod n \quad
		|\ \textrm{substitute} \ x\\
	y^2 &\equiv y^2 & \cdot v_1^{-b_1} v_1^{b_1} &\cdot v_2^{-b_2} v_2^{b_2}\ 
		& ...\ &v_k^{-b_k} v_k^{b_k} &\mod n\\
	y^2 &\equiv y^2 & \cdot \cancel{v_1^{-b_1} v_1^{b_1}} &\cdot \cancel{v_2^{-b_2} v_2^{b_2}}\ 
		&...\ &\cancel{v_k^{-b_k} v_k^{b_k}} &\mod n\\
	y^2 &\equiv y^2 & \color{green}{\checkmark}
	\end{alignat}
	</li>
	</ol>	

	<p>	If she guesses \(b\) incorrectly, not all terms would cross out 
	and Bob's \(y\) would be different from Carol's randomly chosen one.</p>
	
	<p>	The probability that she guesses correctly is \(0,5^k\). This chance reduces even further
	for each round \(t\) of the protocol \(0,5^{kt}\).
	Even for small numbers like \(k = 4\) and \(t = 5\) this is already a chance of 1 to a million.
