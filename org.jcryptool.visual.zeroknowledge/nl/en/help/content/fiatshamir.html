<h1>Fiat Shamir Protocol</h1>

<h2>Intention</h2>
<p>
This mathematical protocol is designed to prove to Bob that Alice
knows a secret without revealing it. It runs in the number space
that is build up on the modulo \(n\) field, with \(n\) being the product of
two prime numbers, \(p\) and \(q\). These two numbers are only known to
Alice and must not be made public.
</p>

<h2>Appliance</h2>
<p>
Alice chooses a secret number \(s\) of the modulo \(n\) field with
\(\gcd(s, n) = 1\) and calculates \(v \equiv s^2 \mod n\).
In the protocol \(s\) will be the secret whereby \(v\) is public
and used for the proving process. One round of the protocol looks the following:
<p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Alice chooses a randomly generated number \(r\) in the
same number space and calculates \(x = r^2 \mod n\).<br>
\(x\) is sent to Bob.
</li>
<li>
Bob then chooses \(b\) randomly, which is either 0 or 1 and sends it to
Alice.
</li>
<li>
Alice calculates \(y = rs^b \mod n\) and sends \(y\) to Bob.
</li>
<li>
Bob checks if the following equation holds true:
\((y^2 \mod n) = (xv^b \mod n\))
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the equation holds, one iteration of the protocol is a success.
</p>

<h2>Vulnerability</h2>
<p>
Carol, the attacker, does not know \(p\), \(q\) or \(s\).
She can try to feign the possession of \(s\) to Bob.
To achieve this she chooses a random \(x\) to send to Bob but has no
influence on \(b\) which she receives.
Therefore we will have two different cases:
</p>

<p>
<b>\(b=0\)</b><br>
If \(b\) is zero, the equation will express as follows:
</p>

\( \style{text-align:right;} {
		\begin{align*}
		y &= rs^b &\mod n\\
		y &= rs^0 &\mod n\\
		y &= r &\mod n
		\end{align*}
} \)

<!--  \(y = rs^b \mod n = rs^0 \mod n = r \mod n\).<br>-->
<p>
That would imply if she has chosen a random \(r\) to calculate \(x\), she
can now just send this number to Bob to prove her knowledge.
</p>

<p>
<b>\(b=1\)</b><br>
If \(b\) is one, the equation will express as follows:
</p>

\( \style{text-align:right;} {
		\begin{align*}
		y &= rs^b &\mod n\\
		y &= rs^1 &\mod n\\
		y &= rs &\mod n\\
		\end{align*}
} \)

<p>
As it is not possible for Carol to calculate \(s\) from \(v\), she would
have to construct her \(x\) and her \(y\) so that it will match the final
check that Bob performs.
This will be accomplished by choosing \(x = r^2 \cdot v^{-1} \mod n\)
and \(y = r \mod n\).
If she constructs the numbers like this she will be able to prove
Bob her knowledge for the case \(b=1\).
</p>

<p>
To deceive Bob in both cases Carol would have to construct a special
\(x = r^2 \cdot v^{-1}\),
 but still must have a number \(r'\) which holds 
\(r'^2 = x\). This is not possible and therefore she can only cheat Bob
for either the case \(b=0\) or \(b=1\), which she must decide before she
receives \(b\) from Bob.
</p>

<p>
As Bob chooses b randomly the probability of Carol to guess right by
constructing a matching \(x\) is \(0.5\). By running ten consecutive
iterations we have a chance to deceive Bob of less than \(0.1\)% (\(0.5^{10}\))
</p>

<p>
By clicking on the <b>run several times</b> button in the main interface,
a Fiat Shamir protocol with adjustable iterations can be simulated
from provers and attackers view.
