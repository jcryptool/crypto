#RabinMainView_compTadDescription=The Rabin cryptosystem is an asymmetric cryptosystem sharing similarities with the RSA cryptosystem. Its security is based on the difficulty of computing squareroots modulo a composite integer n and the integer factorization problem. The unique characteristic of the cryptosytem is that its decryption results in four possible plaintexts, of which only one is the correct one. The plugin demonstrates the Rabin encryption and decryption scheme with a chosen private key pair (p,q), where p and q are distinct prime numbers, and the public key N = p  q, which is used as the modulus.
