  <h1>The Verifiable Secret Sharing Algorithm According to Feldman</h1>

  <p>There are the natural numbers \(n\) and \(t\). In a \((t,n)\)-secret sharing protocol, a secret is
    shared with \(n\) persons. Each person gets one share of the secret. If \(t\) out of the \(n\) persons
    meet, they are able to reconstruct the secret. If less than \(t\) of these shareholders get together, they
    aren't able to get any relevant information about the secret. This principle can be compared to a treasure
    map, which is shared between multiple individuals. Only if all pieces of the map get together, they can
    find the treasure. However, electronic secret sharing is much better: The shares are no partial copies of
    the original map. Therefore, it is necessary to do some calculations in the reconstruction
    step&nbsp;&ndash; and not just put the pieces of the puzzle together.</p>
  <p>According to that, keep in mind that each shareholder could change his/her part of the map and change
    the meaning of the whole map. The verifiable secret sharing algorithm according to Paul Feldman (VSS)
    which extends Shamir's Secret Sharing is able to prevent this.</p>

  <p>
    The <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.visual.secretsharing/$nl$/help/content/index.html">secret
      sharing algorithm of Adi Shamir</a> is based on the Lagrange polynomial interpolation and is a
    \((t,n)\)-secret sharing protocol. All calculations are done within the finite fields \(\mathbb{Z}_p^*\)
    or \(\mathbb{Z}_q^*\).
  </p>


  <h2>How the algorithm works</h2>

  <h3>Step 1: Setting the domain parameters and variables</h3>
  <p>The dealer (also called leader or processor) wants to distribute a shared secret \(s \in
    \mathbb{N}\).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>\(n\): number of players (shareholders)</br>\(n\) has to be a natural number, \(2 \leq
      n\)</li>
    <li>\(t\): number of players for the reconstruction</br> \(t\) has to be a natural number, \(2 \leq
      t \leq n\)
    </li>
    <li>\(s\): secret</br>\(s\) has to be a natural number</li>
    <li>\(p\): a safe prime with the condition <i>\(p > 2s\)</i></li>
    <li>\(q\): biggest prime factor of \((p-1)\)</li>
    <li>\(g\): is the generator and an element of the finite field \(\mathbb{Z}_p^*\) with the
      multiplicative order \(q\)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The dealer sets all the parameters. Aside from \(s\) and the coefficients which are introduced in
    step 2, all the parameters are public for all players. The coefficients and the secret are only known by
    the dealer.</p>


  <h3>Step 2: Creating the polynomial</h3>

  <p>The dealer randomly chooses the secret elements \(a_e \in \mathbb{N} [1 \leq e \leq (t-1); 1 \leq a_e
    < q]\) and uses them to create the polynomial \(P(x)\):</p>

  \( \style{text-align:left;} { \begin{align*} \Large \qquad P(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ... + a_{t-1}x^{t-a}
  \end{align*} } \)

  <p>The polynomial has the grade \(t-1\). The coefficient \(a_0\) is the secret \(s\), so \(P(0) = s\).
    \(P(x)\) is calculated \(\text{mod} \ p\).</p>


  <h3>Step 3: Distribution of the shares and commitments</h3>
  <p>
    The dealer calculates the shares for each player, \(N_i = P(i) \ \text{mod} \ q\). The index \(i [1 \leq i
    \leq n]\) is the ID of the respective player.</br> Independent of that, the dealer calculates the commitments
    \(Y_e [0 \leq e \leq (t-1)]\). </br> The calculation of the commitments works like this:
  </p>

  \( \style{text-align:left;} { \begin{align*} \Large \qquad Y_e = g^{a_e} \mod p \end{align*} } \)

  <p>\(a_e\) are the coefficients.</p>
  <p>The commitments are used later on for checking the integrity of the shares.</p>
  <p>Now each player receives his/her share and all \(t\) commitments.</p>


  <h3>Step 4: Verifying the shares</h3>

  <p>Each player should check his/her share after receiving it. The check consists of the following 2
    calculations.</p>

  \( \style{text-align:left;} { \begin{align*} \Large \qquad g^{e_i} \ \text{mod} \ p \stackrel{\normalsize
  ?}{=} \prod_{j=0}^{t-1} Y_j^{i^j} \ \text{mod} \ p \end{align*} } \)

  <p>
    On the left side, the generator \(g\) is raised to the power of the personal share of the respective
    player.</br> On the equation's right side, the commitments are raised to the power of the player ID \(i\),
    which is raised to the power of the index \(j\) of the product function. This calculation has to be done
    with each commitment and the results are multiplied with each other.</br> If the equation is correct, the share
    is verified. This check has to be done separately for each share, which has to be checked.</br> When the
    players come together to reconstruct the polynomial, the check should be done again to assure that no
    player has changed his/her share.
  </p>


  <h3>Step 5: Reconstruction</h3>

  <p>The construction is used to restore the polynomial which has been generated by the dealer. The
    players can reconstruct the secret \(s\) from the polynomial. To do a successful reconstruction, at least
    \(t\) players (as defined in step 1) are necessary. These players have to provide their personal share for
    reconstructing the polynomial.</p>

  \( \style{text-align:left;} { \begin{align*} \Large \qquad P'(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{u} N_k \cdot \prod_{i \leq l
  \leq u,l \neq k} \frac{x - x_l}{x_k - x_l} \mod q \end{align*} } \)

  <p>
    This formula describes the polynomial interpolation algorithm according to Lagrange. \(u\) is the number
    of shares which have been chosen for the reconstruction \(u \geq t\). \(k\) and \(l\) are the IDs of the
    respective players.</br> The result is the polynomial \(P'(x)\). If enough player are chosen, \(P'(x)\) is
    equal to the polynomial \(P(x)\) which has been defined in step 2, and the coefficient \(a_0\) is the
    secret \(s\).
  </p>
  <p>If one or more of the used shares are modified, the reconstruction will deliver a wrong polynomial.
    That also means a wrong secret \(s\). It is at this point that the improvements to the Verifiable Secret
    Sharing algorithm come to fruition, because such a forgery is noticed with VSS. When using the secret
    sharing after Shamir such a change would not be noticed.</p>
