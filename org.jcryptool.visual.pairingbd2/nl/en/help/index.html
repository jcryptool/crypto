  <h1>Multi-Partite Key Exchange (BD II)</h1>

  <p>Multi-party or multi-partite key exchange (MPKE) are methods to exchange information over
    unsecure/public channels in order to agree on a secure common cryptographic key between more than 2
    parties.</p>

  <h2 id="scheme-general">1) Multi-Partite Key Exchange (MPKE) Algorithms</h2>

  <p>
    Multi-party or multi-partite key agreement (MPKA) [other names used in literature are group key exchange (<b>GKE</b>)
    protocol or conference key establishment protocol] are methods to exchange information over
    unsecure/public channels in order to agree on a secure common cryptographic key (sometimes called session
    key) between more than 2 parties. The first scheme of this kind was the <a
      href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.visual.ecdh/$nl$/help/content/index.html">Diffie-Hellman key
      exchange <b>(DH)</b>
    </a> which described this protocol for 2 parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Multi-partite key agreement protocols are part of the research area of secure multi-party computation (<b>MPC</b>)
    and these protocols are relevant e.g. for video broadcasting, video conferencing (e.g. in Riot or Jitsi),
    mobile phones, or 3G, 4G, or 5G.
  </p>

  <p>Here we consider only such multi-partite key agreement protocols which do not require any trusted
    third party. The original Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHKE) was originally implemented only in finite
    fields of prime order. However, also other cryptographic "settings" can be used namely elliptic curves and
    pairings on elliptic curves.</p>

  <p>
    This visualization shows for an arbitrary number of users the <b>BD II</b> key exchange protocol (named
    after its inventors <b>B</b>urmester and <b>D</b>esmedt), presented in the pairings from Weil and Tate for
    a degree \(k=2\) and in pairings for a degree \(k=12\). More details can be found in [Onete 2008].
  </p>

  <h2 id="plugin">2) Handling Instructions: How to Use this Visualization</h2>

  <p>
    The broadcast BD II algorithm in the pairing setting uses the elliptic curve \(E\) set by default to use
    the short Weierstrass equation \(y^2 = x^3 + 3\). The according users' arrangement is shown in the <b>Protocol
      illustration</b> grouping: Given an initial triangle of 3 users, all users then have up to 4 children,
    exactly 1 parent, and 0 or 1 sibling. If you increment the spinner for the number of users and watch the
    protocol illustration, you can see how new users are arranged in this graph.
  </p>

  <img src="multipartite-graph.svg"
    alt="Graph with 23 nodes. Node 2 to 5 are connected to node 1 and each have 4 children. Node one itself has 2 additional children."

    style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 90%; min-width: 300px; max-width: 600px" />

  <p>After starting the MPKE visualization you can select the pre-setting parameters for the MPKE
    operation using:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Number \(n\) of users to participate (\(3 < n < 101\))</li>
    <li>Embedding degree \(k\) (2 or 12)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For the embedding degree \(k=2\) you have further options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Level of security (pen&thinsp;&amp;&thinsp;paper or industrial security)</li>
    <li>Pairing type (Tate or Weil)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The default parameters (which you also get after clicking on the restart icon) are: \(n=4\), \(k=12\)</p>

  <p>Then on the left, you can see the real initial parameters the program uses according to your
    pre-settings. Currently, these initial parameters cannot be changed manually, only indirectly by selecting
    the pre-settings.</p>

  <p>In the default case (\(k=12\)) these initial parameters are the public parameters: \(q\), \(l\),
    \(E\), \(E'\), \(P\) on \(E\) and \(Q'\) on \(E'\).</p>

  <p>
    Within the <b>Protocol illustration</b> grouping, each user \(U_i\) with \(i=1, ..., n\) has to perform 4
    steps:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step 1: generate secret \(s=r_i\)</li>
    <li>Step 2: calculate public \(Q=Z_i=s \cdot P\) [or \(R_i=s \cdot Q'\)] and broadcast them</li>
    <li>Step 3: users besides the leaves in the graph calculate an additional broadcast value \(X_i\)</li>
    <li>Step 4: each user calculates from his secret s and the received broadcast messages the common
      conference key</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Step 5 is just for verification that all conference keys are equal (this step is only in the
    demonstration, it's not needed in reality).</p>

  <p>
    Below the <b>Protocol illustration</b> grouping is a grouping with used definitions and formulars. This
    grouping can be extracted and folded.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below that is the <b>Details</b> grouping where you can see the calculated values for each user. This
    grouping also can be extracted and folded.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the bottom is the <b>Logging</b> grouping: It shows the needed time and contains the button
    <b>Save results</b>. Clicking on this button generates a file with the default name JCT_BDII_Log.txt. This file
    contains all values (pre-settings, initial parameters, generated and calculated values of all steps).
    Before storing, you have to tell JCT where to store this file to.

Also the DH key exchange protocol can be operated with more than two parties but there is a lot of overhead then. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange]
