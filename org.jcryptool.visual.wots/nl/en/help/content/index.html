  <p>This visualization is a demonstration of the Winternitz One-Time Signature (WOTS).</p>
  <p>
    WOTS is an algorithm to sign digital messages.<br> When using a <b>one-time</b> signature, a pair of
    keys is used only once to sign a single message.
  </p>

  <p>
    JCT contains in several plugins a sequence of visualizations of modern PQC signatures (like XMSS and
    SPHINCS) &ndash; a good and up-to-date overview of such schemes can be found in Wikipedia [1,2]. WOTS in
    the variant WOTS+ is a component of both, <a
      href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.visual.merkletree/$nl$/help/content/index.html">XMSS</a> and <a
      href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.jcryptool.visual.sphincs/$nl$/help/content/Sphincs.html">SPHINCS</a>.

  <h2 id="general">1) General functionality of the plugin</h2>

  <h3 id="input">1.1) Input fields</h3>
  <p>
    All "input fields" can be edited. Only the <b>message</b> field has to be filled with text by the user;
    all other fields are calculated by pressing the buttons <b>Generate signature</b> or <b>Validate
      signature</b>. The calculated fields continue to be editable in order to show the correctness of the
    signature validation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Message</b> <br> A message can either be entered manually or be loaded from a text file.
      Alternatively, the standard message can be used. Any change of the message automatically updates the
      fields Message digest and \(b_i\) if the button <b>Show details</b> has been pressed.</li>
    <li><b>Message digest</b> <small>(only when <b>Show details</b> is activated)
    </small><br> The content of this field is the calculated hash of the given message.</li>
    <li><b>Keys</b> <br> These fields show the calculated keys.</li>
    <li><b>Signature</b> <br> This field contains the signature after it has been calculated.</li>
    <li><b>\(\boldsymbol{b_i}\)</b> <small>(only when <b>Show details</b> is activated)
    </small><br> The content of this field is the value of \(b_i\). For further information on how it is
      calculated see chapter <a href="#siggen">Generate signature</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  alt="Screenshot of the plugin. Left the input fields for message, Winternitz parameter,
  hash function, mode (normal or plus) and the keys. In the top right a description and bottom
  right a visualization..">

  <p>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3 id="param">1.2) Parameters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Winternitz parameter \(\boldsymbol{w}\)</b> <br> Determines the level of compression
      while generating the keys. Possible values are integers greater 1. Using a bigger value for w leads to
      smaller keys, but also increased runtime.</li>
    <li><b>Hash function</b> <br> It is possible to switch between three hash functions: SHA-256,
      SHA-1 and MD5 (SHA-1 and MD5 should not be used in real implementations due to successful collision
      attacks).</li>
    <li><b>WOTS/WOTS+</b> <br> It is possible to switch between these two variants. Please note that
      after this switch the fields "Message", "Keys", and "Signature" will be cleared. For further information
      about the differences between WOTS and WOTS+ see chapter <a href="#wotsplus">WOTS+</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <b>General information to avoid misuse:</b><br> Below every editable field, the actual length and the
    target length of the field are displayed. While editing in any field the actual value will change
    dynamically, and it changes to red if actual and target value of the field length don't match.<br>
    You may use arbitrary symbols while editing the message field, but all other fields accept only
    hexadecimal values (0-9 and A-F). If an invalid symbol is entered, the field will change its color to red.<br>
    As long as either invalid symbols are present, or the actual and target values don't match, the
    possibility to edit other fields is disabled.
  </p>

  <h3 id="button">1.3) Buttons</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Load message from file</b> <br> Opens a dialog to choose a file, which is subsequently
      displayed in the message field.</li>
    <li><b>Generate keys</b> <br> A valid pair of keys is calculated and displayed in the key
      fields. For further information on how keys are generated see chapter <a href="#keygen">Key
        generation</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Generate signature</b> <br> A valid signature will be generated using the given private
      key, and displayed in the signature field. For further information on how a signature is generated see
      the chapter <a href="#siggen">Signature generation</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Validate signature</b> <br> The given signature will be validated using the public key.
      If the signature is valid, the signature field will change its color to green. If the signature is
      invalid the color will change to red.</li>
    <li><b>Show/Hide details</b> <br> It is possible to enable details such as the fields Message
      digest and \(b_i\). This is a pure visual feature which has no impact on the actual algorithm.</li>
    <li><b>Reset</b> <br> Clears the calculated values (key and signature), but doesn't change any
      other values or parameters. So the message field is left unchanged.</li>
    <li><b>Restart</b> <br> The plugin will be set back to its original state. In contrast to the <b>Reset</b>
      button, here also changed parameters or messages are set back.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There is a dependency between the buttons "Generate keys", "Generate signature", and "Validate signature"
    concerning their activation: The button <b>Generate signature</b> is disabled as long as the button <b>Generate
      keys</b> has not been pushed. The same applies for "Validate signature", which is only activated after a
    signature has been generated.

  <h4 id="usedParam">2.1.1) Used parameters</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>\(\boldsymbol{n}\)</b> = Size of a block in byte <br> n is determined by the chosen hash
      function (for instance, SHA-256 creates a 32 byte (256 bit) output, so n is 32).</li>
    <li><b>\(\boldsymbol{m}\)</b> = Size of the hash value of the message in bit<br> The hash value
      of the message using SHA-256 has a length of 256 bit.</li>
    <li><b>\(\boldsymbol{t}\)</b> \(= t_1 + t_2\) = Number of blocks which form each key <br> This
      number is calculated in two steps, and it is the sum of their results \((t_1, t_2)\).</li>
    <li><b>\(\boldsymbol{t_1}\)</b> \(= \lceil\frac{m}{\log_2(w)}\rceil\) = number of base-w elements
      generated from a message <br> whereupon the result is rounded up.</li>
    <li><b>\(\boldsymbol{t_2}\)</b> \(= \lfloor\frac{\log_2(t_1(w-1))}{log_2(w)}\rfloor+1\) = number of
      base-w elements generated from the checksum <br> whereupon the result is rounded down.
  </ul>

  <h4 id="privkey">2.1.2) Private key \(X\)</h4>
  <p>The private key \(X\) consists of \(t\) blocks, each containing \(n\) pseudorandom bytes.</p>

  <h4 id="pubkey">2.1.3) Public key \(Y\)</h4>
  <p>The public key \(Y\) also consists of \(t\) blocks. These blocks are generated by hashing each block
    of \(X\) \(w-1\) times.</p>

  <img src="images/keys.png" style="width: 70%;min-width: 650px;max-width: 1000px"
  alt="Screenshot of the plugin after the key creation . The bottom right visualization shows,
  how the public key is created by hashing the blocks of the private key.">

  <p>

  <p>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3 id="siggen">2.2) Signature generation</h3>
  <h4 id="genB">2.2.1) Generation of vector \(\boldsymbol{B}\)</h4>
  <p>
    <b>\(\boldsymbol{B}\)</b> consists of \(t\) blocks. To get these blocks, a checksum of \(m\) (\(m\) is the
    hash value of the message) is calculated. To be able to do this, \(m\) is converted to base \(w\).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>\(\boldsymbol{C}\)</b> \(= \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{t_1} w-1-m_i\) = Checksum.
  </p>
  <p>Now, both \(m\) and \(C\) are converted to base \(w\), which results in \(t\) values (\(m\) base
    \(w\) has \(t_1\) values, \(C\) base \(w\) has \(t_2\) values). If necessary, \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) are
    padded with 0s in order to calculate their correct values.</p>
  <p>For further calculation, the \(t\) values of \(B\) are interpreted as integers.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Example:</b> block \(b_i\) = 0111 = 7
  </p>

  <p>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h4 id="signature">2.2.2) Signature</h4>
  <p>To generate a signature, each block \(X_i\) of the \(t\) secret key blocks is hashed \(b_i\) times.
    The results are \(t\) blocks, which form the signature \(\text{sig}\).</p>

  <img src="images/signature.png" style="width: 70%;min-width: 650px;max-width: 1000px"
  alt="Screenshot of the plugin after signature creation. The visualization shows how the bits of 
  m and C are hashed.">

  <p>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3 id="sigver">2.3) Signature validation</h3>
  <p>
    To validate a signature, the vector \(B\) is calculated the same way as in section <a href="#genB">2.2.1</a>.
    Each block \(\text{sig}_i\) of the signature is hashed \(w - 1 - b_i\) times. The resulting check
    signature consists of the blocks of the private key, which have been hashed \(w-1\) times each (\(b_i + w
    - 1 - b_i\)). Because the public key also consists of the \(w-1\) times hashed blocks of the private key,
    the public key and the calculated check signature should be the same. If this is the case, the signature
    is valid.
  </p>

  <img src="images/validated.png"  style="width: 70%;min-width: 650px;max-width: 1000px"
  alt="Screenshot of the plugin after the signature verification. The visualization shows how the
  signature is hashed and compared to the hashes of the public key. The verification was successful
  as the signature field has turned green.">

  <p>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h2 id="wotsplus">3) WOTS+</h2>
  <p>The difference between WOTS and WOTS+ is how each block is processed. In WOTS+, an additional
    bitstring \(R\) consisting of \(w-1\) blocks (\(n\) bits each) is generated. When hashing the blocks for
    the \(i\)-th time, an additional XOR with the \(i\)-th block of \(R\) is applied.</p>

  <h3 id="bitstring">3.1) Bitstring \(\boldsymbol{R}\)</h3>
  <p>
    <b>\(\boldsymbol{R}\)</b> consists of \(w-1\) blocks, each block containing of \(n\) pseudorandom bits,
    which are added to the beginning of the public key \(Y\).
  </p>

  <h3 id="example">3.2) Example</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Calculation of the first block of the public key \(\boldsymbol{Y_1}\):</b> Before hashing the block
    \(X_1\) for the first time, an XOR operation with the first block of \(R\) (\(R_1\)) is applied. Before
    hashing it the second time, an XOR operation with the second block of \(R\) (\(R_2\)) is applied. Because
    the block is hashed \(w-1\) times in total, \(R\) consists of \(w-1\) blocks.<br> <br> <b>Calculation
      of the first block of the validation signature:</b> Assuming that \(b_1 = 6\) and \(w = 10\),
    \(\text{sig}_1\) will be processed \(w - 1 - b_1 = 3\) times. For the first block, \(R_1\) is not used for
    the XOR operation, but \(R_{b_i + 1}\) is. The reason behind this is to get the correct value, which can
    be compared to \(Y_1\) (first block of the public key).
  </p>

  alt="Screenshot of the plugin in WOTS+ mode. The interface is the same as for the original WOTS.
  The visualization shows additionally how the blocks of the message are calculated as XOR with
  the vector R.">

  <p>
    <br>
  </p>
  <h2 id="security">4) Security</h2>
  <p>
    For both algorithms it is absolutely necessary that a pair of keys is only used to sign one single message
    (one-time signature), otherwise it would be possible for an attacker to learn the whole private key by
    signing two chosen messages. As a solution to this problem, it is possible to authenticate many one-time
    public keys with a binary tree through a single hash (see Merkle trees).<br> <br> The security
    of both algorithms strongly depends on the used hash function. WOTS requires a collision-resistant hash
    function, WOTS+ a <span style="white-space: nowrap">2<sup>nd</sup>-preimage-resistent
    </span> hash function. In conclusion, WOTS+ has less requirements to the used hash function, but is more complex
    in calculation.
