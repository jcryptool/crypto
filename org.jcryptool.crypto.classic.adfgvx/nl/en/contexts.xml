    <description>The ADFGVX cipher consists of digraph substitution (replace each pair of letters with another) and transposition. The substitution is based on a 6x6 square, which sides are labeled with A, D, F, G, V and X.
    &lt;br&gt;This cipher was used by the Germans in World War I, but deciphered by French analytics soon after its deployment in the German communication.
