#Eclipse messages class for SigComposite
SigComposite_grpSignatureGeneration=Signature generation
SigComposite_grpSignedDoc=Signed document
SigComposite_description=This visualization demonstrates the creation of a digital signature for a specific document. A digital signature can be used to authenticate the sender's identity or the identity of the document's signer. It also ensures the document's integrity.

SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep1=\r\nChoose Input\r\n\r\nYou can choose what to sign: Either you open an existing document or you enter a text by yourself. To start the signature process, you have to click the button "Choose input" on the left and follow the instructions.
SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep2=\r\nChoose Hash function\r\n\r\nA hash function is an algorithm or subroutine that maps data sets of variable length to data sets of a fixed length (digest). Signing the message digest rather than the message improves the efficiency of the process because the message digest is usually much smaller in size than the message. The same hash algorithm used by the creator of the digital signature must be used by the verifier of a digital signature. 
SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep3=\r\nChoose Signature function\r\n\r\nYou can choose between different signature functions to sign the document. Some signature procedures are based on asymmetric encryption like RSA, other methods have been developed only for this purpose, for example DSA. To sign a document and verify the signature, you need two different keys. The private key is for generating the signature and has to be kept secret. The public key can be used by someone else to verify your signature.
SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep4=\r\nThe receiver can authenticate the origin and can be sure that the message has kept its integrity. Click on the button "Show generated signature" to show the signature of the chosen input. In this Wizard you get all relevant information about the generated signature \u2013 the creator, information about the key and about the signature method. It is also possible to choose between different display options.
