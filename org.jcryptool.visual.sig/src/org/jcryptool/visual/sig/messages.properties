#Eclipse messages class for SigComposite
SigComposite_grpSignatureGeneration=Signature generation
SigComposite_grpSignedDoc=Signed document
SigComposite_description=This visualization demonstrates the creation of a digital signature for a given document (message). A digital signature can be used to verify the identity of the message's signer.

SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep1=\r\nChoose input\r\n\r\nYou can choose what to sign: Either you open an existing document or you enter a text by yourself. To start the signature process, you have to click the button "Choose input" on the left and follow the instructions.
SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep2=\r\nChoose hash function\r\n\r\nA hash function is an algorithm that maps a data set of variable length (the message) to a data set of a fixed length (hash value or message digest). Signing the hash value rather than the message improves the efficiency of the process because the hash value is usually much smaller in size than the message.
SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep3=\r\nChoose signature function\r\n\r\nYou can choose between different signature functions to sign the document. Some signature procedures are based on asymmetric encryption like RSA, other methods have been developed only for this purpose, for example DSA. To sign a document and verify the signature, you need two different keys. The private key is for generating the signature and has to be kept secret. The public key can be used by someone else to verify your signature.
SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep4=\r\nThe receiver can authenticate the origin and can be sure that the message has kept its integrity. Click on the button "Show generated signature" to show the signature of the chosen input. In the following dialog you get all relevant information \u2013 the creator, information about the key and about the signature method. It is also possible to choose between different display options.
SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep4_Success=\r\nSignature generation was successful!\r\n
